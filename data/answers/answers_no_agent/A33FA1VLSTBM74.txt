I randomly selected it since this was my first turn.
########
I wanted to see if my second spin on machine 1 would return more money.
########
I wanted to see what machine 2 offered.
########
Machine 2 was so much more than machine 1 that I though it was 2 good to expect again.
########
Machine 2 paid out more in 1 pick than machine 1 did in 3.
########
I expected machine 1 to get better.
########
Machine 1's return on the second spin in a row is usually higher than the firt spin.
########
Machine 2 offered better returns for me.
########
This was an error. I sneezed as I was moving my mouse, and clicked machine 1 instead of machine 2.
########
I was hoping for a turn around in machine 1 results.
