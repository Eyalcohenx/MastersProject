I had no information so i was just trying a machine.
########
I won a high prize from my perception the first round so I chose this one again.
########
the prize from my second try was lower so I chose the opposite machine.
########
The prize amount was equal for the 2nd and 3rd tries so I opted to give #1 another chance.
########
#2 was yielding higher results on average so I chose it.
########
I made a mistake and should have chosen number two but the amount was less so I didn't think it through.
########
Number 2 was giving a higher average prize.
########
The prize from the previous round was disappointing so I tried this machine again.
########
I felt like the prize was sufficient from the last round so I stuck with #1.
########
The average payout was lower so I went back to #2
