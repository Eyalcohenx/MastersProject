I just used my intuition and felt drawn to the second so I chose it.
########
I was curious to see if the first one would have a decent payout as well.
########
I wondered if the first might have a payout hiding in there somewhere. 
########
The first one wasn't paying out as well, so I was wondering if the second would be better.
########
It's paying more, so I decided to stay on it.
########
I was wondering if the higher payout would happen at this point. 
########
I wanted to keep trying for machine 1. 
########
I thought the second would have a good payout after a brief cool down. 
########
I thought the first machine might have the higher payout at this point. 
########
The second seemed to be higher paying so I returned to it.
