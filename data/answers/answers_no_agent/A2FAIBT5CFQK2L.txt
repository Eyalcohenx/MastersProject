I just went with a gut feeling 
########
I wanted to try the other machine 
########
I was seeing if a pattern would work in my favour
########
I decided to change the pattern
########
I was starting to like this machine better
########
I felt like I was getting too comfortable with machine 1
########
I thought I would try it again it worked in the previous round
########
I thought of trying another pattern
########
I felt like it was going to well with machine 2 so I changed
########
It was a gut feeling to change machines
