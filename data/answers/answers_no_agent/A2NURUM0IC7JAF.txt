I chose the one the  left because I am left handed so I tend towards "left."
########
So, I got a jackpot on the first try. The instructions said one machine would be better than the others. Is this the better one? I should try it again. 
########
Okay, so maybe it isn't this one. I am going to try the other one and see how it goes. 
########
Okay, this one also gives jackpots. I tried the other one twice. I am going to try this one as well. 
########
I got a second jackpot on this one. So far better than the other one. I am going to try it again. 
########
I think that this one is giving out better money so far I am going to stay with this one. 
########
Still getting 90% high jackpots. I am going to stay here. 
########
I feel as though I am stuck on this machine now. Cant change over. 
########
Just keep on this one till the end. Its still paying well and consistently. So I'll stay
########
Gonna keep staying here.
