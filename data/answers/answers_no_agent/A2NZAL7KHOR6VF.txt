I like to start with number one.
########
I wanted to see what the other machine would do.
########
It also gave a high reward, so I thought I would try it again.
########
After a low score on 2, I thought maybe this was the lower machine. I was trying to find the machine that was better than the other.
########
I thought this might be the good machine, so I kept picking it.
########
It seemed like this might be the more consistent machine.
########
I thought this was the higher paying machine.
########
I thought this was probably the higher paying machine.
########
I thought this was the higher paying machine. I didn't want to risk going back and forth. Thought it would be better to stay consistent.
########
The payout was too low. Thought maybe I was wrong and number 2 was the higher paying machine, so I switched.
