Since this was the first round, I chose machine number 1 as a starting point.
########
For the second round, I chose machine number 2 to start building a basis of comparison between the two machines.
########
I chose machine number 1 to see if the higher payout continued.
########
I chose machine number 1 again to see if a pattern of higher payouts was forming.
########
I chose machine number 2 to see if the first payout from this machine was comparable to the first, so I could start comparing averages.
########
I returned to machine number 1, since although I did not have enough rounds to see a pattern for machine number 2, machine 1 still had a higher average payout.
########
I wanted to look for a pattern of high/low payouts for machine number 2.
########
Since the previous payout for machine number 2 was the highest so far, I wanted to see if the pattern continued.
########
With the previous payout from machine 2 being relatively low, I wanted to continue to compare the average payouts between machines 1 and 2.
########
The previous payout from machine 1 was the lowest from that machine so far, so I wanted to see if that continued or if it resumed its pattern of higher payouts.
