It gave me a jackpot before, so I carried on.

Another jackpot, so I carried on.

########
Same as before...

At this point i was pretty sure that since this machine only gave jackpots and never missed, it was the better one, so I carried on...

...But then I started to wonder if both machines wouldn't always pay, and decided to choose the other one to see if the prize was bigger.
########
The prize WAS bigger, so I stuck with it.

I came to the conclusion pretty quickly that machine #2 was the high paying one at this point.
########
So I stuck with it.
