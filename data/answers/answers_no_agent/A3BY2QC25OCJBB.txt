It didn't really matter which one i chose i just wanted to see what each one was like so i started here
########
I picked this one because i had already picked the other one. now i wanted to see what this one did
########
Since this machine hit higher i decided to try this one again. knowing that which ever one i chose i would choose the other one next time.
########
Since I had chose machine 2 twice and this one once i tried this one again to get a better feel of this machine
########
I decided to give this one another try because i wanted to give it a fair chance 
########
I thought number two might be the better machine so i chose this one
########
I felt like this one was still doing better for me so i chose it again
########
I felt i was doing well so i decided to stick with this one
########
Again I thought this was a good choice so i kept with it
########
I was happy with what i was getting so i didn't see the need to change it
