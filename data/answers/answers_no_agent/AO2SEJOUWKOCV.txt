It was the first round and it was just a random decision
########
I won a reward on the first slot and went ahead with the same one, as I had already won once
########
I won a reward on the first slot and went ahead with the same one, as I had already won twice on the same slot
########
the rewards on the first slot went down and started to become smaller, hence i decided to change the slot machine, hoping that a new one would bring better luch
########
the reward I won on slot no 2 was much higher than the last reward for slot number 1 hence decided to move ahead with the 2nd slot again
########
the 2nd slot machine looked more favorable and the rewards were comparatively high when compared to slot 1 hence moved ahead with slot 2 again
########
the reward for slot no 2 started going down and the last round on slot 2 paid very few cents, hence decided to move to slot 1 and try over there
########
i observed that anytime you switch between the slot machines the rewards were higher hence decided to change the slot at intervals
########
