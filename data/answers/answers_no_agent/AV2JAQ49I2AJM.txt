I chose machine 1 because it was the first machine on the page. It didn't make sense to choose one over the other so I wanted to gather some baseline data to begin.
########
I wanted to see how much machine 2 would pay initially after I'd had the 14 cent result from machine 1.
########
I continued with 2 because it paid out higher initially.
########
I continued with machine 2 because it was a high payout.
########
I continued due to the high payout of the previous turn.
########
I wanted to see if machine 1 would now rise. I was more curious than anything.
########
I wanted to see if it would rise as it had done previously from 14 to 22.
########
Once I determined machine 1 was not going to have a drastic jump to produce machine 2's rewards, I went back to 2.
########
I wanted to continue with the machine I knew had the higher rewards for now.
########
Again, this machine seemed to dish out higher rewards.
