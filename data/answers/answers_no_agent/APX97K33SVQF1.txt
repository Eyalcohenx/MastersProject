Just to begin the experiment. 
########
Needed to see what machine 2 would output.
########
The difference in reward was enough for me to start thinking machine 2 was the better one.
########
Kept winning way more than with machine 1 so I kept at it.
########
Same as before, seemed as if I was on a roll.
########
Number went down on machine 2 so I gave machine 1 another shot just in case.
########
MAchine 1 gave a better reward than what it had initially given but it was still under the average of machine 2
########
Machine 2 kept looking more promising.
########
Still promising.
########
By this time I thought machine 2 was the best one.
