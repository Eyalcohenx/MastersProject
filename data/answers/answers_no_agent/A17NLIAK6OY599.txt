It's the first one and they look the same, a simple gamble.

let's stick with what works
########
i liked the big win i had just gotten, see what kind of streak we can get on
########
I like the numbers i'm seeing so far
########
I'm on a streak of good wins, which to me is about 50c per round
########
I don't want to miss out on these bigger rewards
########
I'm getting kind of bored with my choice but I can't resist
########
Time to break away, as we've gotten a pretty big accumulated bonus (again, in my eyes). I feel safe to try something new
########
Was disappointed in the first win amt on Machine 2, but wanted to see if I could start to match Machine 1's amt
########
Another low amt on 2, so back to the old standby
