I chose machine number 2 based on gut instinct.  It kept pulling my eye that way.
########
I felt this machine may be "hot" and ready to hit a jackpot again so I decided to stick with machine 2.
########
I felt machine 2 maybe getting near a dry point and would not pay off again so I switched to machine 1.
########
When machine 1 paid off I felt that machine 2 may still be "hot" and may be the better of the machines so decided to test my theory and switch back to machine 2.
########
I wondered if my theory was right and machine 2 was the better machine and since it has paid off I stuck with it.
########
I chose what I thought might be the better machine but now it has dried up perhaps.
########
Some times when you think a machine has "dried up" it can surprise you by coming "back to life" so to test this I chose machine 2.
########
Well I now think machine 2 is my lucky machine but if I look at the averages you have spelled out for me on this page the payout is not as great as I thought it was.  I did not realize I hit machine 2 more times for just a slightly larger amount than machine 1 which I only picked once so far. 
########
Because I didn't realize the payout was only slightly larger for a lot more hits on machine 2 than machine 1 and because so far machine 2 has been hitting decided to stay with machine 2.
########
Time to switch machines and try machine 1 again in the hopes of a higher payout so went back to machine 1.
