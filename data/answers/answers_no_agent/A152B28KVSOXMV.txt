I picked the first machine because it was the first round.
########
I won on the first so I tried again on the same machine.
########
I won even more on machine 1, so I picked it again cause I thought I was on the machine that paid the most maybe.
########
I lost on the last round so I thought ok....if I play at least 10 rounds, I'll do 5 on the first and 5 on the second...unless I lose big on the second.
########
I decided this would be my last try on this machine unless I lost on the second machine more.
########
Wow! Got the highest pay out yet, maybe this is the winning machine!
########
Won again, maybe I was on the wrong machine before.
########
I'm still winning on machine #2!!
########
Got another win. I'll finish out my spins on #2 machine!
########
This is my 5th spin on #2 machine hope it wins. My odds are already better on this machine.
