I tried machine one at first to see if I could get an idea of what kind of payout it would be
########
I was hoping that machine two would have a higher payout since machine one was a little disappointing
########
Machine two did well the last round so I decided to try it again
########
This machine continues to have better payouts so I decided to keep going with it
########
it is still giving mostly decent payouts although there is a low one occasionally. It's still high enough that I think it's the better machine
########
I felt there were enough higher payouts that it would continue to do well most of the time
########
I want you to see if machine one could possibly pay out more than just a few pennies and make sure I wasn't making the wrong choice by sticking with the other one constantly
########
I was giving it another chance since the payout was a little better last round and still trying to see if the payout would be as good as machine 2
########
I was still trying to give it more chances to see if there was anything higher than around $0.50 before I decided to go back to the other machine or not
########
I decided that machine one was never going to be as good as machine two so I moved back to this one
