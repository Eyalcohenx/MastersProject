Because the first reward was good and it didn't seem like changing was a good idea.
########
I thought the first question was for round 2! The machine payed well in round one so it seemed dumb to switch.
########
The 69 cent reward seemed high again so why switch? It didn't make sense.
########
Once again, it was a good reward as far as I could tell, so I didn't want to switch.
########
I decided I would only try a different machine if it went below 50 cents and it didn't.
########
I was tempted to switch, but I can't imagine they were actually gonna be paying any more than the decent rewards I was consistently getting.
########
I BELIEVE I only had 6 picks, so I don't THINK I had a 7th round.
########
There wasn't a round 8 so I'm not sure how to answer this question.
########
I once again erred because I thought I only had 6 choices, but it really meant 6/6 as in the dice. The machine seemed to be "hot." Why change?
########
The machine continued to pay out and I saw no need to switch. I was getting tempted just to see.
