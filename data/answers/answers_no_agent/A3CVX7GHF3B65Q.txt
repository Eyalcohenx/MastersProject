Had to start somewhere so I arbitrarily picked 1
########
I chose 2 to see how it would do compared to 1
########
It provided a higher payoff than 2 in the previous round
########
Since 1 gave me a low amount in the previous round I switched to 2
########
Since I did fairly well with 2 last round I stayed with it
########
Again, since I did fairly well with 2 last round I tried it again.
########
I thought I would give 1 another try, since on the first round it did fairly well.
########
Since 1 did great last round I tried it again
########
I stayed with 1 since last round was another good payoff
########
I tried 2 to see if it would provide a good payoff.  Took a chance.
