I chose randomly to begin with.
########
I chose the machine again to see if the low reward was a pattern.
########
I chose machine 2 to compare its payout to machine 1.
########
The last round had a better payout, so I stuck with machine 2.
########
Because Machine 2 was continuing to pay better, I kept playing on that one.
########
I assumed Machine 2 was the better-performing one and continued to play on it.
########
I wanted to double-check my assumption that machine 2 had the better average payout.
########
Because Machine 1 paid out a large amount, I checked it one more time.
########
Over 4 turns, machine 2 was the better machine, so I continued to play on that one.
########
I assumed Machine 2 would continue to be the better choice.
