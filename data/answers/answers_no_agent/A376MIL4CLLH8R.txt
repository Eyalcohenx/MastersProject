This was a guess because it was first try
########
I thought since I won a little on machine 1, I would maybe win more the second time.
########
I was really curious as to what would happen with machine 2. Average 48 right now wanted to see if I would average more
########
I realized my average would be different for machine 2. It's only 11 so I thought I had a good chance of improving like I did with machine 1 before.
########
I felt I had 50/50 chance as I had already pulled both twice, so I wanted to see if a pattern would start with machine 2. 
########
I started feeling lucky on machine 2 so I kept it up.
########
I wanted to continue on 2 because I didn't see a pattern yet.
########
I got mad that my average went down on 2 and still no pattern. Plus, I started thinking that the main factor was if I rolled a 6 or not-not the machine I was choosing.
########
Both averages almost the same. Saw it as 50/50 chance. 
########
Got annoyed my average went down and decided to take a chance again on 1.
