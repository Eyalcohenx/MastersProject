As this was the start of the game I felt that it didn't really matter which one I chose first.
########
It felt lucky because I got 54 on the last turn.
########
I thought that machine 2 probably wouldn't give 3 good results in a row therefore I chose number 1
########
Machine 2 felt lucky so I went back to that one.
########
I thought I would give it another try as the last time I used this one the result was pretty low.
########
This machine has been giving me higher rewards so far.
########
Felt more comfortable because it was giving me good results.
########
I wanted to risk it and see what kind of results I would get since I haven't been choosing this one very often.
########
I think I had a good result and wanted to see if I could repeat it.
########
This one seemed to have the better average than machine 1
