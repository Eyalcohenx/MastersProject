A random choice, so I started with the first machine.
########
I wanted to see how machine 2 compared to the machine 1 payout.
########
Machine 2's payout was higher than machine 1, so go with machine 2 again.
########
Again, machine 2 was higher, so keep with it
########
Machine 2 was again high, so keep with it.
########
The last payout from machine 2 was low, so try machine 1 this time.
########
Machine 1 payout was higher than the recent machine 2 payout, but still less than earlier machine 2 payouts, so try back to machine 2.
########
Try again to see if low payout was just a fluke.
########
Relatively low payout again on machine 2, so switch back to machine 1.
########
Machine 1 had a higher payout than the recent machine 2 spins, so stick with machine 1.
