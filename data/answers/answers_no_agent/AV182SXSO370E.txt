I just felt that everyone would pick 1 to start with and I didn't want to be like everyone  
########
On average picking the same machine in a row increase your odds of another pay out 
########
In this case I didn't want the AI to start tracking me... so I switched it up.
########
While I was unsure of this was a wise choice ... I went with it warranty
########
Again, I thought I would press my luck and choose the same machine 
########
My theories were not wise and I went back t the higher payout machine.
########
I just felt like alternating machines.
########
The odds were in my favor to choose the higher paying machine
########
Again, I just decided to stay the course and continue with 2
########
The odds were not looking good therefore, I decided to alternate machines.
