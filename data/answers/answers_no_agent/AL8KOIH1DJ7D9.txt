It was a 50/50 choice, and I had to start somewhere
########
I wanted to see what the other would do
########
2 looks better, let's try that again
########
Okay, I think 2 is the right choice, but let's try 1 again to be sure
########
Yes, looks like 2 is the winner
########
Still good. This could be over any round now, so I think 2 is the safe bet
########
I don't think it's worth triple-checking 1 at this point, going to stick with 2
########
Each round could be the last, so I'll keep playing it safe with 2
########
Same as before, playing it safe here
########
Wow, still going. This really could be the last round. Sticking to 2, I'm confident it's the winner.
