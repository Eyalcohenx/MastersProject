I didn't know anything about either machine, so I just decided to go left to right.
########
I felt pretty good about 34 cents from machine 1, it felt high, but I wanted to at least get some information about the other machine, even though I think it won't be as good.
########
As I thought, machine 2 wasn't as good as 34 cents.  That made me think machine 1 was the better machine, so I went back to machine 1.
########
I was really disappointed with 6 from machine 1.  That made me wonder if it really was the better machine.  Since the first pull on both machines were within 10% of each other, I though maybe machine 2 might be better after all.
########
Machine 2 delivered well again.  Now I think it is probably the better machine.  I pull on machine 2 again.
########
Not a fabulous reward, but not a terrible 6 like I got from machine 1.  I am back in doubt, but since I've had no single-digit returns from machine 2 I go back to it.
########
Wow, that's a nice result from machine 2.  I have less doubt.  I think it's probably the better machine now, unless it gives me a really disappointing number.
########
Holy Cow!  Machine 2 is even better than I thought.  All doubt is gone.  Machine 2 is clearly the better machine.
########
At this point I'm convinced machine 2 is the better machine, and I'm starting to focus on the dice letting me continue to reap these large rewards.
########
I love machine 2.  I will always choose it as long as they let me.
