I chose machine number two since it is my lucky number and I wanted to start with my lucky number.
########
I once again chose it because I got 92 cents in my first try so I gave one more chance to it.
########
I wanted to give a try to number one as well.
########
I thought that number two is the machine that helps me get more coins.
########
I thought to try my luck once again in number one machine.
########
I realized that I was not getting much coins through number one machine.
########
The average number of cents I was getting through number two was higher than number 1.
########
After choosing number two in a row I thought that I should again go for number one, I might get more cents there.
########
I tried number one and regretted for it since I got less cents than I had expected.
########
I realized that number two machine is the one that gives more cents than machine one.
