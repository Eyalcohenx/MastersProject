no reason, just guessed to start with.

Just tried 2 again for kicks and did well
########
Thought I'd change it up a bit--did do so well
########
Thought I'd try 1 again, just for luck, didn't do so well
########
Went to #2 for better luck--won 62 cents
########
Seemed like #2 was hitting the best, so tried again, only got 10 cents
########
Didn't want to change my strategy--felt lucky, tried #2 again, only got 14 cents
########
Went back to machine #1--won 42 cents.
########
Not sure why I went to #2--only won 11 cents
########
went back to machine 1 and won 20 cents.  Wish I could keep playing. :)
