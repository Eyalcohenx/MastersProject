I just randomly decided to go with the machine on the right.
########
I stuck with my first choice so it would have at least two results.
########
I decided to see what machine 1 would do.
########
I needed another result for machine 1 so I could see the average of both machines after 2 results.
########
Machine 2 had the higher average, so I went back to machine 2.
########
Stuck with machine 2 because the average is still higher.
########
Machine 2 average still higher, so picked machine 2.
########
Machine 2 still has higher average.  It has been paying out well, so I stuck with it.
########
I stuck with machine 2 because odds were in my favor that the payout would get higher instead of lower.
########
With the average decreasing again on machine 2, I decided to try machine 1 again.
