Since I have absolutely no information yet, it didn't matter to me which one I picked.
########
I hadn't played machine 2 yet, so I played it to get some information.
########
I still need more information (as one play each isn't a good sample size) I play number 1 as it has a higher average right now (though that may not be accurate).
########
I have more information on machine one than 2, so since they are both low info I played the machine that needs more info (this being 2)
########
The average payout is slightly higher on 2, so I picked it (as right now they have even usage at two each, but still not enough info the be sure of either's average).
########
I Picked machine 1 because it had less usage (2 vs 3), and I still need a bigger sample size.
########
As they have the exact same average and usage (45 cents and 3 picks), I went with machine 1 as it really didn't matter.
########
Machine 2 still is one pick behind 1 (3 vs 4). As there is still not enough of a sample size to determine an accurate average, I went with the option that gives me more information.
########
Machine 1 had sightly higher average (1 cent) and and equal usage, so I chose this machine to get more info
########
Machine 2 needs more information in order to accurately determine the average.
