Because I decided to just start with the first machine to see what would happen 
########
I needed to see how it compared to the first machine to try and determine which was better
########
Because it was higher on my first pull than the second one was
########
To see if it would continually perform higher 
########
Because I had determined that 1 would not always be a higher payout I had to start trying to see if there was a pattern 
########
Because  I had not had luck with pulling the same machine back to back to I needed to go back and forth 
########
I had to get the pattern correct, at this point I determined that going back and forth would result in the best reward. 
########
I had chosen 1 the previous pull and going back and forth had been yielding the highest reward 
########
because the amount before was very high I decided to continue with this machine 
########
The previous pulls were going up by 1 penny each time so I wanted to see if the pattern would continue
