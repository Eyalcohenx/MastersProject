A complete random choice, as it was the firt draw
########
I chose the same machine because I had got a good first try
########
I switched to the second one because I had not tried it yet. I wanted to see if there was a difference between the two
########
I wanted the same amount of tries to make the comparison
########
I switched back to the machine 1 as I had done 2 tries on each machine
########
In order to have 3 picks on each side
########
Choice completely random, as I had 3 picks on each side
########
In order to have 4 picks on M1 and on M2
########
Random choice again, when I compared I had the feeling that there were no differences between the two machines
########
In order to have 5 picks per machine
