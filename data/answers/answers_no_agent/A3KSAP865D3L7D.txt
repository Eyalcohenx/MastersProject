As this is a first round. I picked it randomly.
########
This time I tried it with another machine
########
I thought machine 2 gave more than machine 1 gives
########
Again I tested machine 1 for whether its random or machine only gives more.
########
Reason Machine 1 gave me only few, so i tried out with machine 2 it works

########
Now I can understand that machine 2 always giving high reward
########
I did mistake here
########
I rectify my mistake here by choosing again machine 2
########
I continued with machine 2 and got more rewards
########
Finally I got least from machine 2 and its the last round.
