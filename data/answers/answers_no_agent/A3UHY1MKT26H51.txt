I just decided to start off with the machine on the right.
########
47 cents was a good number, but I wanted to see if machine #1 would give more or less.
########
I decided to pick machine 2 to see if I could see a pattern emerge.
########
I picked machine 1 again to check my theory.
########
Machine 2 seemed to give a better payout, so I decided to stick with it.
########
Machine 2 seemed to still be consistent with bigger payouts.
########
I decided to still stay with machine 2 hoping for a larger payout.
########
Machine 2 was still my choice because it seemed consistent.
########
I looked at the average cents per pick and decided to try machine 1 again.
########
The cents per pick seemed kind of equal, but I decided to go back to machine 1.
