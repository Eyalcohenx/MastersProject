My eyes just veered to the right.
########
Because it paid quite well on round 1.
########
Because it seemed to continue to pay well.
########
I wanted to see if Machine 1 paid well.
########
I gave Machine 1 another chance.
########
Machine 1 was paying badly so I went back to machine 2.
########
I decided to stick with machine 2.
########
I decided that machine 2 was the better paying one.
########
I decided that machine 2 paid better.
########
I was going to stick with machine 2 till the end.
