I pick this machine for first round randomly, because I didn't know the behavior of any of the machines yet.
########
I chose machine 1 again because the first round prize in this machine was satisfactory enough.
########
I wanted to explore the behavior of the machine I had not tried yet to check if it gave much bigger prizes.
########
I picked machine 2 again because the previous round prize from it was the highest I have had in any round.
########
I stuck to machine 2 because its prizes were pretty good.
########
I thought machine 2 prizes were big enough and I was hoping I could get a bigger one.
########
I didn't get prizes above the average on machine 2 so I decided to turn to machine 1 to see if a great jackpot above anything I have had yet was waiting for me.
########
I decided machine 2 was getting me a higher prizes on average and I started to realize I was not going to get unusually bigger jackpots, so I decided to keep hitting machine 2 to accumulate a bigger reward in the end.
########
As in the previous round, I realized prizes were close to an average in every round so I didn't find any reason to keep exploring any other machine.
########
I would've been hitting machine 2 as long as the dice allowed me to, because I was confident it would get me prizes on the average.
