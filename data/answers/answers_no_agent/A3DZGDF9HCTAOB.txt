I tried this when I believed that I would get greater benefit than machine number 2
########
When I found that machine number 1 did not yield as much bonus, I chose machine 2
########
I chose machine number 2 when I saw that it gave a very good jackpot payment and I received better payment than machine 1.
########
I tried to get better payment
########
Machine 2's payment could end up being higher
########
Machine 2's payment started deteriorating
########
Machine 1's payment was not as much as I had expected.
########
Machine 1's payment could be higher than machine 2
########
I had anticipated that machine 1 will pay more
########
Machine 1 payment was very low so I opted for number 2 in the hope that I would get better bonus
