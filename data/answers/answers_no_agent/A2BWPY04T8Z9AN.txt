Since both machines were similar I randomly chose number one and felt confident to go with the first choice available.
########
I thought I had good results and I kept with the same Machine.
########
I wanted to keep the streak rolling and continued with the same choice.
########
I kept going with the same machine while it still showed good results.
########
I was on a streak with this machine. 
########
Still on a streak in my opinion and didn't want to switch course.
########
Again, results were fairly good and I didn't want to change it.
########
I didn't want to change machines at this point.  Waiting for a bigger hit.
########
Same as before.  Kept with the same machine.  Didn't want to change my luck.
########
Kept with one.  Didn't want to change.
