I have no information on which is better, so might as well go with the first one.
########
I don't have information on Machine 2 to compare to Machine 1, so I'll try it out.
########
Machine 1 seems better, but it's impossible to say based on just the one result on each so far, but I'll try Machine 1 again since it did give a higher initial payout.
########
Machine 1 only gave me a payout of 15 the second time around, so clearly there's quite a range of possibilities. I will try Machine 2 this round.
########
Machine 2 only gave me 34, which is less than either machine in the first round, but greater than Machine one in the second round. I will try Machine 1 again to see if it gives me a better result (and it's still higher on average).
########
At this point Machine one gave me another low figure (17) and Machine 2 is higher on average, so I will go with Machine 2.
########
With a payout of 62 here from Machine 2, and a higher average payout, I'm reasonably confident that Machine two will probably have a better average payout going forward, so I will go with that choice from here on end.
########
After round 7, I deduced that Machine 2 probably has higher average payouts (and none of my rolls seemed to disprove that hypothesis), so I resolved to stick with that for the rest of the experiment.
