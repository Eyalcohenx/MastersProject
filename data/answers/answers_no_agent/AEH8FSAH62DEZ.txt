I had to pick one of the two options so I decided on Machine 2. 
########
I chose Machine 2 again because I liked the high reward I got after the first time and I figured it was a good option to try again. 
########
The average was high enough for me to justify picking machine 2 again and so I did in the hopes of maintaining the high average. 
########
I kept picking machine number 2 because the average was still quite high and so I wanted to keep the winning streak going. 
########
I picked machine two again to maintain the winning streak and because the average so far was pretty good at this point. 
########
I chose machine number 1 purely out of curiosity. While I had maintained what I perceived as decent winnings I wanted to see if machine 1 would have a similar outcome. 
########
The result of picking machine 1 was a substantially lower average return to pick ratio, so I decided to go back with what I thought was the more lucrative option, machine number 2. 
########
I continued picking machine number two because the average was substantially higher than going with one and I wanted to increase my winnings more. 
########
I chose machine number 1 again out of curiosity to see if it was a worthwhile pick second time around with respect to the average return, and if it was significant enough that it would be worth trying 1 again if I were fortunate enough to get to choose between the two once more after this choice. 
########
Seeing that the average was still not great for machine number one I went back to what I perceived to be the better return on choice to reward outcomes, and therefore I chose machine number two in this round to continue to get the higher average return.
