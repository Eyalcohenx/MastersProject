Was just started out so seemed logical to use the first machine available. 
########
I had already picked one, wanted to see what two would do 
########
1 had won more so far 
########
1 had still won considerably more 
########
1 seemed to be giving out more each time
########
1 was still giving more than last time each time 
########
1 was still giving more each time I played it 

########
I decided to try something different! 
########
I wanted to see if 2 would give more each time I played it as 1 had 
########
Went back to 1 as it was doing better overall
