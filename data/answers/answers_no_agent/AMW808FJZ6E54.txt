I tested the machines and then chose the machine that had the highest average in my results. 
########
The accumulated reward was lower so I tried the other machine. 
########
I wanted to see if the rewards from the machine were really low or it was bad luck. 
########
After receiving a higher reward the second time, I was curious to see if it would give me a high reward again. 
########
I chose Machine 1 again to see what the average would work out to be after choosing it the other times. 
########
I wanted more information on the average reward on machine 2.
########
I wanted to continue to test the average and get machine 2 to the same number of picks. 
########
I chose machine 2 because I wanted to compare the averages of the 2 machines to try to determine which had better rewards.
########
I chose machine 2 again because I wanted to see the averages when the machines both had 4 picks. 
########
Machine 2 had the higher average after testing which had the highest average with the same amount of picks so I chose it again.
