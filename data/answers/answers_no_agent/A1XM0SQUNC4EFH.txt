I haven't tried either machine yet, so one is as good as the other right now. This was pretty much a random choice. 
########
I have tried the first machine, so now I want to try the second machine. 
########
Having tried both machines I see machine 2 paid higher, but I really don't have enough information to judge so I will try machine 1 again.
########
I am still trying to get more information about how well each machine pays. I'm keeping an eye on the average pay out per pick, but still need more information about both machines.
########
Machine number 2 seems to be paying a little better on average, so I try it again to see if this trend continues. 
########
Machine 2 still seems to be paying a higher average than machine 1, so I try it again.
########
The difference between the average payouts is not very large, so I go back to trying machine 1 again to see how it performs.
########
Machine 1 now seems to have a higher average, so I try it again to see if the trend continues.
########
With four picks on each machine I find machine 2 still has a slightly higher payout, so I am going to play it again.
########
Machine 2 has a lower average now but I want to try it again because I feel it has paid well in the past.
