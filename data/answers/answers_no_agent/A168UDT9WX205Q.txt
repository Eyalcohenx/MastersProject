I chose machine 2 because it said Jackpot after the first round. Because one machine is better than the other, I chose it because it said Jackpot. 
########
It gave me 30 cents and I felt that was a good prize.
########
I didn't want to choose the bad machine so I chose number 2 again.
########
I felt that I was winning when I chose number 2. 
########
The dice said I could have another round after I chose number 2 so I chose that machine again for luck.
########
I had accumulated a reward that I felt fair so I chose number 2.
########
The number 2 machine was giving me good prizes and I felt that I chose the right machine.
########
I was used to choosing machine number 2 and didn't want to switch to machine 1.
########
I felt that it was easier to keep choosing number 2 because it was giving me prizes.
########
I had committed to choosing machine number 2 for many rounds now. It felt weird to switch.
