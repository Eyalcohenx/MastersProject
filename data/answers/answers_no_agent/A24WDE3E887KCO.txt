I decided that I usually pick to my left on the page so I would go opposite to begin.
########
I liked my reward from the first pull so decided to stay with it.
########
I figured I won a dime and wanted to win more. I stayed with this machine but I was tempted not to.
########
I am not sure why I stayed here. I just wanted to win more money.
########
I saw an average over 70 cents and thought that maybe I was lucky finding the machine that paid higher right off the bat.
########
I saw my count go lower and decided I made a bad mistake staying with this machine.
########
I wanted to make a change and was hoping I could get more than an 80 over on this machine.
########
This made me happy over here. I think I really just like watching those balls spin and change color so that now it was just a fun game.
########
I went back to what could bring me more points in my own mind. This part of the screen felt comfortable and familiar.
########
I gravitated to the second machine for reasons unknown and would have kept right on pulling for those same unknown reasons.
