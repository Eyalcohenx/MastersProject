I chose what the helper recommended.
########
I won a decent amount on the last round so I went with the same machine.
########
Machine 2 had a lower cents average than before so I went with the other machine.
########
Machine 1 didn't give me many cents last round so I'm going back to Machine 2.
########
I have been doing well on machine 2 so I plan to continue using it.
########
It seems the helper really does know which machine is better; I'm continuing with machine 2.
########
Profits have been good on machine 2 so I plan to keep using it.
########
The helper has been helpful for most of my rounds so I am going to trust her judgement.
########
The good luck on machine 2 continues so I plan to keep using it.
########
Profits have been good on machine 2; I plan to keep using it.
