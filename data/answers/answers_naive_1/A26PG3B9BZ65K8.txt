Nothing had been picked yet, so I took the helper's advice.
########
I won a decent amount on the first pick, so I took the advice again.
########
I won even more on the second pick so I took the advice again.
########
The winnings went down, but I thought it may be an aberration so I kept with the advice.
########
I won a good amount again, so I stuck with the advice.
########
I didn't win as much, but it had paid out more times in the past so I went with the same machine.
########
I was hoping the machine would pay out like it did earlier.
########
Machine 2 didn't pay out like I had hoped, so I switched.
########
Machine 1 paid off well so I chose it again.
########
It again paid out well, so I chose it again.
