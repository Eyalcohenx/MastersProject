That was the firs choice, I wanted to know if the helper was really right
########
I wanted to know the potentiality of the other machine, if it was really so bad
########
Even if I won with machine 1 in previous turn, I didn't want to risk to have a bad won
########
I saw that the machine and the advice were going well so I kept with this machine
########
I wanted to try once again the other machine to see if the luck was with me 
########
I got a great win in the previous turn so tried again
########
I had a bad turn so went for helper's hint
########
I followed once again the helper because I felt more confident
########
I had a bad result so went back to the other machine
########
With machine 1 in the previous turn I had the worst experience so went back for helper
