I wasn't sure which machine had the better outcome yet, so I decided to trust the helper.
########
The first round went well, so I picked the same machine again.
########
I wanted to see what outcome I could get from the other machine (to compare).
########
The second machine had a better outcome than the first, so I went back to it.
########
The second machine felt generally better, so I went with it again.
########
Again, I felt that this option was giving me better outcomes.
########
I decided that only trying the first machine once was not giving me much information, so I tried it again.
########
I wanted to keep getting information to be able to accurately compare the two machines.
########
I wanted to get more information to compare the two options.
########
The second machine had a better average, so I picked that one.
