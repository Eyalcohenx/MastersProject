As I don't know anything about the machines, I follow the helper's advice.
########
I continued trying with the machine that the helper recommends.
########
I gave another try to this machine to see if the rewards are high.
########
I thought maybe the helper wanted me to choose machine number 2 because that was the machine that was giving them some cents, so I decided to try with the other machine.
########
In order to be able to calculate the average, I needed to choose machine number 1 several times.
########
The rewards seemed higher for machine number 1, so I decided to continue playing with it.
########
The rewards were still high so I chose machine number 1 again.
########
The rewards were still higher for machine number 1, so I chose it again.
########
I had the doubt that maybe the lower rewards of machine number 2 were just by chance, so I thought giving another try to machine number 2.
########
The rewards of machine number 2 were just slightly lower than number 1 to this point. So I gave it another opportunity to see how the reward was.
