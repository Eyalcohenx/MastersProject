I'm ambidextrous with a left-handed preference, so I just tend to choose whatever's on the left for starters.
########
The 57 cent win seemed good enough to choose this machine a second time.
########
Since the reward in the last round was not that great and the helper keeps recommending the right hand side machine, I'm going with the recommendation for this round.
########
Very satisified with the win in this round, sticking with the recommended machine.
########
Average win and helper's rec say right machine, thumbs up.
########
Sticking with higher average.
########
Same as last round
########
Same reason as two previous rounds
########
Still sticking with higher average
########
Still higher average, despite occasional lower win. Helper seems to know what they're doing.
