I had no reason to choose one machine over the other so I chose the machine the was recommended to me.
########
Since I had already used the machine I was recommended, I thought I should go with it again to get a little bit better idea of the average reward.
########
The second time I used the helpers advice I got a wildly different reward than the first time.  I then decided to use machine 1 to see how it compared to the machine I had been using.
########
Just like the first two, I felt I needed a second try with Machine 1 to get a better idea of the range of/average reward.
########
I was doing slightly better with the machine I was not recommended, but I did get a very high reward the last time I used the machine the helper recommended.  I then decided to adopt the helper's advice once again to see if it was on the higher end of rewards again.
########
Last round was once again a pretty high reward when going with the helper's advice on machine 2.  I was tempted to stick with that machine but I decided to switch it again to see how high the reward this round would be on machine 1 because I had received a rather large reward last time I used it but a low reward the first time(which was the same circumstance as machine 2).
########
The reward for machine 1 last round was decent but not as impressive as the last two rewards for machine 2 so I decided to go with the helper's advice and use machine 2 to see if I could get another high reward.
########
I continued to get good numbers with adopting the helper's advice, so I decided it would probably be a better reward if I stayed with machine 2.
########
I was getting better results from machine 2 but the average was slowly coming down.  I had used machine 1 less than machine 2, and wondered if I had just gotten unlucky with machine 1 and maybe it would have a better average if I tried it more.  I heavily considered staying with the helper's advice again,  but wanting to take a risk and the curiosity of the outcome made me choose machine 1.
########
After another rather mediocre result, the average difference between machine 1 and machine 2 was important.  While I was definitely skeptical about the helper's recommendation being out of self interest rather than my benefit, I couldn't ignore the average difference between the machines.  I then decided to go with the helper's advice and use machine 2.
