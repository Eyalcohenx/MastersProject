I just decided that I might as well go with the helper, since either machine could be good at this point.
########
I had some idea that machine was paying decently, so I chose it again.
########
The machine was still paying all right, so I chose to follow the helper and stick with it.
########
The average was still all right, so I stuck with the helper.
########
I had gotten a few low rewards, so I decided to see what the other machine would do.
########
The other machine gave me a poor outcome, so I went back to the helper's choice.
########
The average was better on that machine, so I stuck with it.
########
The machine seemed more apt to keep paying out, so I went with the helper.
########
My one try on the other machine was bad, so I was sticking with the helper.
########
The average was actually going up a little, so I stuck with the helper's choice.
