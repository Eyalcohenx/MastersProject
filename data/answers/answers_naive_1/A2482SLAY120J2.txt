The helper has information I don't; so, I have to trust the helper and I chose the helper's recommendation.
########
The helper's pick in the first round was profitable, so why change. I stuck with the helper's recommendation.
########
Again, the helper's advice was profitable, why change now.
########
So far the helper's picks have been profitable and at this point it seems that the machine on the right must be the correct one.
########
Why switch now. We're winning.
########
I going with machine 2 and the helper all the way. No reason to change.
########
The helper is right. No need to change.
########
Machine 2 seems to be a sure thing. And the helper is right.
########
I keep on winning no need to change.
########
I'm on a roll keep with the helper's advice.
