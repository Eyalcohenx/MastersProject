I decide to pick the helpers recommendation to see if the amount would be the same
########
After 2 times picking the helpers recommendation I wanted to see the amount of the 1st machine would be
########
I picked machine 1 again because it was a higher amount then machine 2 has giving me at that point
########
I decided to go back to machine 2 because I wanted to see the average amount between both machines 
########
I picked machine 1 to even out the amount of times a picked for each machine
########
I picked machine 1 again to keep the number of times I picked each machine 
########
I picked machine 2 to even of the times I picked for each machine 
########
at this point I though machine 1 was giving higher amounts than machine 2 
########
I went back to machine 2 see if the helpers recommendation would be higher amounts
