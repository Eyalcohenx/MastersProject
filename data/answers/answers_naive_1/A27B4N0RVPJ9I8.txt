I decided I would trust the first choice that the helper made
########
I felt that their choice wouldn't be as rewarding as mine
########
I thought the odds were in my favor here
########
I decided to come back to the helpers choice to see what the difference in reward would be
########
I thought my choice would yield a better reward
########
At this point, I was hoping that the benefit of making my own choice would outweigh the helper's pick
########
I was hoping for another better outcome with my personal choice
########
My choices weren't getting me the results I had hoped for and at this point I realized I was benefiting more by choosing the helper's choice
########
I had hopes of trying my choice again thinking it would be decent in comparison
########
I came this far with choosing my choice over the helper and figured I'd finish it off with my choice
