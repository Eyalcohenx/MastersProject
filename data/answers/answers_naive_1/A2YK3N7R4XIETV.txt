I chose the helpers advice because it was the first round, and the helper knew something I didn't. 
########
I chose this machine based on the helpers advice in this round because the payout was good in the first round.
########
I chose to try my own luck this round to see if the different machine would have a different or better payout. I doubted that three times in a row the second machine would have a good payout. 
########
I decided at this point to go back to the helpers advice to see the difference in pay out.
########
I again trusted the helpers advice up until this point so I kept with machine two.
########
Even though the helper suggested the other machine I was feeling lucky this round and followed my gut. 
########
My gut feeling ended up being not as great as I had hoped so I again adopted the helpers advice. 
########
The payout seemed to be decreasing on machine two, so against the advice of the helper I chose machine one.
########
I wasn't expecting a big hit twice in a row on the same machine so I was feeling confident that the helpers advice was good this round. 
########
The helpers advice didn't pay out as well as I had hoped so I tried again to go with my own instinct on machine number one.
