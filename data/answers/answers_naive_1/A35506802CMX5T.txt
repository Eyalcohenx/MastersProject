Needed a base to start with might as well start with the recommended machine
########
Wanted to see what the non recommended machine offered
########
machine one was higher pay out than the recommended so chose it again to see if first pay out was fluke or average
########
Machine 1 continued to pay higher than recommended machine so stuck with it
########
Lower pay out on machine 1 so went to see if machine 2's first pay out was a lower than average for the machine 
########
Machine 2 continued to pay lower than one so went back to 1
########
machine 1 continued to out perform machine 2 so stuck with it
########
Machine 1 consistently paying out close to 50 cents opposed to the under 20 cents of machine 2.  
########
The helper doesn't seem to be helping me since their machine pays out low.  Perhaps its just the first few payouts that are low but I have no reason to trust someone that is being paid to lead me to a certain machine when I don't know how many attempts I have and the other machine is proving to be fairly reliable in its pay outs
########
Machine 1's low pay outs are higher than machines 2's normal pay out
