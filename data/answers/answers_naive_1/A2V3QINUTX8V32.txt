I decided to test the helper's advice. To establish if it would be helpful.
########
As the reward was a little bit low, i decided to follow the helper's advice again, in order to establish if the helper was advising me the "wrong" machine.
########
The reward increased, so i decided to go with the helper's choice.
########
I got a "fair" reward, so i decided to follow the helper's advice again.
########
The reward was good, so i continue to follow the helper's advice.
########
Good reward. Then i just follow the helper's advice again.
########
Nice reward, then i continue to follow the helper's advice.
########
Fair reward, then i decided to follow the helper's advice one more time.
########
Good reward, then i decided to trust the helper's advice again.
########
