I knew it benefited the Helper for me to choose that machine, but I wondered if their goal was to recommend a machine that gave a lower average so I decided to choose Machine 1.
########
I had a good result for the first round, so I decided to keep with Machine 1.
########
The previous two rounds I had decent results. I could have chosen the other Machine, but I still didn't want to risk a lower reward.
########
I noticed I was getting 10-20 in terms of a reward from Machine 1 and it apparently were Jackpots which I assumed was good. So I kept picking Machine 1.
########
I received a HUGE leap in virtual cents from Machine 1, and because it was so high, I thought it was possible to get even better rewards with the same Machine.
########
I kept receiving high amounts with Machine 1, so I picked it again.
########
I was receiving large rewards from Machine 1 so it made sense for me to keep going with picking this particular Machine.
########
I still did not feel like taking the Helper's advice because I was receiving good rewards from Machine 1 and I didn't want to risk getting lower ones.
########
I am happy with my previous choices picking Machine 1 over the Helper's recommendation, so I kept choosing Machine 1.
########
Like before, I did not want to risk using the Helper's advice so I continued to pick Machine 1.
