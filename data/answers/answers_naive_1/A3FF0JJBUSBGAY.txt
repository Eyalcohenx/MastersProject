Since the helper knows the odds of each machine, I decided to start off by following the helper's advice.
########
Following the helper's advice on the first round seemed to pay off, so I decided to follow the advice again.
########
The instruction claimed that one of the machines performs better on average, so I began to to think that the helper's advice was steering me towards the machine with the better odds.
########
The helper's advice seemed to be paying off, so I was sticking with the advice.
########
I decided to stick with this machine and the helper's advice for the time being.
########
Around this time, I began to notice that the average cents per-pick was beginning to drop, but I decided to keep taking the helper's advice. 
########
I kept sticking with the helper's advice to try and establish a pattern.
########
Again, I decided to keep sticking with the helper's advice.
########
Last round, the machine paid out 0 cents, and I felt that it was time to go against the helper's advice and try the machine that hadn't been picked yet.
########
Since the average per-pick was dropping on the recommended machine, and the other machine paid 100 cents last round, I decided to go against the helper's advice again.
