I just follow the helper's advice for the first round.
########
The helper's advice seems to be good on round 1 so I continue to follow him.
########
Same reason as the precedent round. The results were good so far.
########
The prize was decreasing so I test not to adopt the helper's advice to see what happen.
########
The prize not adopting the helper's advice on precedent round was terrible so I choose to follow the helper's advice again.
########
Same reason as for the last round. Prize decrease again.
########
As the prize was not good on last round, I tried again not to adopt the helper's advice.
########
I won a good prize without the helper's advice on last round so I try again not to follow him.
########
Prize was one more time terrible not following the helper's advice last round so I follow him again.
########
Same as last round. The average prize with the machine 2 was in addition superior to machine's 1 one.
