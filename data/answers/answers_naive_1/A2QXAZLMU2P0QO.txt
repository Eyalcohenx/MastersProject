I chose this because the instructionns stated that the helper knows what machine might have a better chance to win, so I took a chance and went with the helpers choice. 
########
I chose the the helpers choice machine because the machine won money last time the helper chose the machine. 
########
I was curious if that machine wouuld win if I chose it. I decided to take a chance. 
########
Since the machine I chose last time without the helpers choice, produced a win, I wanted to see if the same results would happen again. 
########
I chose the machine number two because I thought the other machine would probably not win three times in a row. 
########
I was curious to see if it would win again since I picked it on round #5. I was curious if I would lose money or not. 
########
I took another chance to see if my choice would result in a win or not. 
########
I chose machine one because I did not think that the helpers choice machine would win again. 
########
I choice the helpers choice machine because I though that number one would not produce a win. 
########
I was curious to see if I would win by chosing the first machine since I just picked the helpers choice machine on round#9.
