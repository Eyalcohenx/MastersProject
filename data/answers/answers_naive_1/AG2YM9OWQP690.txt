It was a 50/50 shot and the machine had better chance of correctly guessing . 
########
I won the first round and willing to stick with winning machine. It was greater chance of winning .
########
I was winning and it kept giving me good rewards and I was scared to choose machine 1. I stuck with my good luck.
########
I had a good feeling and knew it was getting riskier but the rewards would be worth it. I took a chance since machine had given me good luck and good fortunate. 
########
I was really getting nervous and didn't want to find out what happened if I choose machine one . I decided to keep with helper. It didn't fail me yet. 
########
The average coins was acceptable and I was winning. I was happy to keep with helper. If I had gone on one more time I probably would of picked machine 1 just to see what happened. 
########
I had good luck and helper knew what the best one was so I decided to keep going . I was getting very nervous though and wanted to see what would happen if I picked machine 1. 
########
I was on a winning streak and helper supposedly knew what they were doing so I get picking what it said it recommended. I was curious what would happen if I picked machine 1. 
########
I was like well I won every round and helper has not let me down so far so lets keep picking it. At this point I really was wondering what would have happened if I picked machine 1. 
########
Again I was like well I won every round and helper has not let me down so far so lets keep picking it. At this point I really was wondering what would have happened if I picked machine 1. However, I had good luck and was doing well.
