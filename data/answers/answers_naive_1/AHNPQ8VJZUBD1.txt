There was no information to decide more for myself so choosing the recommended machine could not hurt at this point. I needed to collect some data anyway.
########
Since the helper recommended the same machine I began to assume it was the machine that benefited the helper, not necessarily me so I wanted to see what machine 1 would produce.
########
Machine 1 gave a lower return than machine 2 so I was hopeful that the recommendation was benefiting the helper as well as the one with better odds. With limited data it was worth checking again. 
########
The helper was consistently choosing machine 2, I began to think that the helper would never change the recommendation and that it probably meant that machine 2 was either the one that earned them a commission or it was the best odds or both. Since the average payout between the two machines was similar I began to think that their recommendation was useless and wanted more data for myself. 
########
Machine 1 showed a higher return overall, I now firmly believed that machine 2 offered the commission to the helper so their recommendation meant nothing. I was trying to collect my own data now. 
########
2 had a higher average payout so I was relying on that for now. 
########
The payouts were essentially equal so I wanted to keep checking data on both machines. 
########
I was simply going with the higher average payout by this point. 
########
The higher average matched the recommendation so I went with it again. 
########
I was sticking with the higher payout average.
