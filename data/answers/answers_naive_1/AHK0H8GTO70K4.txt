I had no knowledge of either machine or the helper, so I started with the helper since they knew the machine amounts.
########
I had a good first spin with the helper, so I went with them again.
########
The second spin was not as good as the first, so now was a good time to see what the other machine could produce.
########
Machine 1 was not particularly good and made the helper's second spin seem better, so I switched back.
########
It was another good spin with the helper, so I decided to stick with them.
########
I don't think I had any reason other than to see if machine 1 was unlucky on my first spin there.
########
At this point, it seems like the money in machine 1 just isn't as good as in machine two.  It's also possible that the helper is pointing me in the right direction the entire time and not just helping themselves.
########
I think it was just a bad spin, though I don't totally remember why.
########
Machine 1 provided another relatively bad spin.  At this point, I am just going to follow the helper's advice and take machine 2.
########
The helper seems to be right every time so far, so I am just following their lead.
