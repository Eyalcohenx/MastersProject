I went the second machine because the helper suggested it even though it hadn't picked yet.
########
I won a fairly decent amount so I stayed with the same machine.
########
If a machine is winning, you keep hitting it until loses or makes a minimal payout.
########
I like winning and the other machine was untested.
########
It was still paying decently so why change?
########
The helper hadn't let me down so far.
########
I just decided to stick with what I and the helper knew: this machine was a winner.
########
The helper's choice continued to be a winner so I kept choosing it.
########
At this point, I didn't want to go against the helper and change machines.
########
The prize seemed to keep going up or staying steady with each round, so I kept going with the helper.
