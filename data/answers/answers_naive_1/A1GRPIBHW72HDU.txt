It was my first choice so I went with the recommendation.
########
The first choice paid out well so I Went with it again.
########
I was curious to see what machine 1 was paying out
########
I wanted to get another look at what machine 1 was paying like
########
Machine 1 was paying horribly so I Went back to machine 2
########
I had a better chance of getting a good payout from 2 over 1.
########
I didn't want to get a low payout from 1.
########
I wanted to make sure the first two times with machine 1 wasn't just bad luck.
########
I chose I would go with machine 2 from that point forward because machine 1 always paid low.
########
Machine 2 always paid better
