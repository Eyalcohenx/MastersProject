Because it was the first round, I decided to go with the helpers choice to see what would happen. 
########
I decided to choose the helper's advice because the last round got me a high score
########
The first two scores were good so I decided to go with it again
########
The machine had given me a jackpot and the average was still over 50 cents 
########
I had been given my first low score and wanted to see what the other machine would give. 
########
I received a low score on the last machine so I figured the helper had been right. 
########
I was still doing well so I decided to keep going on that machine.
########
Still did well. Average was above 60 cents
########
average went up to 62 cents. most of my spins were good. 
########
Average was still going up, so it made sense to use that one.
