I wanted to see what the helper's vice would result.
########
I wanted to compare the other machine to the one the helper picked
########
I liked that machine better based on the second spin so chose to spin it again.
########
I liked that machine, it had better return's than the helper's machine.
########
I wanted to see if my luck on that machine had changed
########
I chose to adopt the helper's advice again.
########
I felt that I was doing better when I wasn't listening to the helper.
########
I thought the first machine had higher payouts on previous spins.
########
I chose to listen to the helper but regretted it afterwards.
########
Machine number one is better in my opinion.
