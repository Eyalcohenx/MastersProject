Selected machine 2 because helper had more knowledge about the machine than me and it was first round
########
The award was good in the first round so selected the machine as per helper's advice
########
went again with the helper advice because the accumulated reward was not bad
########
wanted to try something new and check what reward I will get if I select machine 1
########
the award was more the average of machine 2 so tried machine 1 again

########
again average was better than machine 2 so went with machine 1
########
again because of more average went with machine 1
########
the reward was less but thought next round will get better rewards 
########
average was still better than machine 2 therefore went with machine 1 
########
Thinking that will get better reward because earlier round the reward was less
