At this stage, I had no personal experience with the game so I chose to trust the helper was giving me good advice.
########
I was curious to see if machine 1 would give me a larger reward than what machine 2 did.
########
Machine 1 gave me a larger reward than when I chose machine 2 so I stuck with it.
########
I wasn't satisfied with machine 1 earnings so I went back to machine 2 to see if the reward would get larger.
########
The average of my pics was higher for machine 1, so I went back to that machine.
########
My reward lowered significantly so I went back to machine 2.  
########
The reward was good so I stuck with the helper's advice and machine 2.
########
The reward continues to be high when I chose to adopt the helper's advice.
########
My reward dropped significantly so I went back to machine 1 hoping it would be higher.
########
My reward seemed OK so I stuck with machine 1.
