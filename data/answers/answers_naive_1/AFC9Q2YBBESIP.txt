I thought that what would benefit the helper would benefit me.  So, I followed the helper's recommendation.  
########
My approach seemed to be working so far, in terms of the bonus benefit, so I continued using the same approach and following the helper's recommendation.  
########
The approach was continuing to work, so I continued to follow the helper's advice.  
########
I still felt that I was choosing what was best for me and for the helper.  I was reluctant to try a new choice.  
########
I  considered switching choices because my average was going down, but I had no guarantee that it wouldn't go down further if I switched machines.  "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
########
I seemed to hold steady in terms of the average of my picks (rather than go down further), so I continued with the same approach i.e. following the helper's suggestion.   
########
I was determined not to change my approach, no matter what the results of any given lottery.  
########
My results were favourable and so I continued with my resolution.
