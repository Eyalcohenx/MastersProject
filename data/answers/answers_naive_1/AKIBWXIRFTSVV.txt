I needed to get a basis somewhere, so went for their recommendation to start.
########
I received a decent bonus (more than I thought) in the previous round, so went with the helper again.
########
I got an even higher bonus, so wanted to stay with the helper's recommendation.
########
Once again, the high bonus made me somewhat loyal to the helper so I could keep getting more.
########
Still a decent bonus and I was happy the helper was getting a reward too.
########
I was curious about the other machine at this point and how much I could be getting on the other machine so had to try it out.
########
I got about the same as I did on the other, so wanted to give machine 1 a try again against the helper's advice and ended up with a large bonus.
########
Because of the previous large bonus, I wanted to keep with machine 1.
########
I still got an average bonus out of machine 1 and wanted to keep seeing where it went. It seemed to be more of the direct gamble machine while the helper's machine was more consistent.
########
Because the machine 1 was going down in bonus, I thought to go for machine 2 again to see if it went in waves.
