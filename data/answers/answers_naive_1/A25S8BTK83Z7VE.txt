Starting out decided to trust the helper and see how that went
########
I won what seemed like a fair reward so I decided to stick with it
########
The jackpot kept going up, so I decided to stick with it again. Perhaps the helper was rewarded the more I won
########
The average jackpot still seemed quite high so i saw no reason to change
########
Again, the average payouts were good so I was beginning to trust the helper
########
I felt like riding the helpers recommendation would be a good way to keep winning.
########
The payouts continued to be around the value or higher that I first received and I was still happy with that.
########
Again, the winnings seemed consistent and I could win a 10 cent bonus for every two rounds which I was happy with following the helpers recommendations.
########
I started to get curious if the other machine would pay out higher and felt I had accumulated enough reward to give it a try.
########
The reward from the other machine was pretty good but I wanted to see if it would go up or down.
