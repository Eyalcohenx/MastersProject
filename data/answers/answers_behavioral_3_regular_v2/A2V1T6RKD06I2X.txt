Helper appeared reliable so I used it again.

Stii felt that using the helper was for the best.

Things were going pretty well so why not use the helper again.

Same as before I trusted the helper.
########
I got curious about the other machine's possibilities.

Helper was working for me so why not.

Trusted the helper for better returns again.
