Neither machine had been played so I thought it was best to go with the helper's advice and choose machine 1
########
After going with the helper the first time and receiving a fairly high number, I felt it was best to continue on this path since the helper suggested machine 1 again.
########
I felt I could go all the way through the game just choosing machine 1 because of the helper, but I was curious on machine number 2 and what it might bring so I chose it this round. Additionally, the second round was not as high as the first round on the first machine.
########
Choosing machine 2 last time, actually turned out ok, but I still though the helper knew more than me so figured it was better to stick with the helper's advice.
########
The average on machine 1 was still high and I decided to continue with the helper's advice.
########
Again, curious as to machine 2 and the one time I chose it in the past, it paid well so I wanted to give it another shot.
########
I went against the helper's advice last round and it didn't turn out too well so thought I should continue with the advice on selecting machine 1.
########
Again, just sticking with the helper's advice.
########
Average was still better than machine 2, so still sticking with the helper's advice.
########
Had one high payout and one small on machine 2 and wanted to see what would happen. I usually go with the helper's advice, but also am curious and like to take the risk of option 2.
