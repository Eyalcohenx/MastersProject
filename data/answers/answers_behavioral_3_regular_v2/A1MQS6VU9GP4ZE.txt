I want to go with my own decision.
########
I expect something more than what i choose myself.
########
The previous result was no that good as expected.
########
I feel helper is giving less.
########
Satisfied with the result of my own choice.
########
Stick to the opposite choice of helper.
########
Not believing helper actually helping to gain more.
########
To verify that my decision is correct, not to follow helper's advice. 
########
I found the other choice is better so far.
########
Decided to neglect helper's advice.
