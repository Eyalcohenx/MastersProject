This was my second choice so I stuck with the choice I made first to see what the average would be 
########
I wanted a larger sample so I picked #1 again
########
I wanted to see what the other machine would do. 
########
I won a large amount so I kept with machine #2
########
The average was higher on machine 2 so I picked it again
########
The average was higher so I picked machine 2
########
The helper kept on machine one so I picked it again to see if the average would go up
########
I tried machine 1 agin based on the helpers advice
########
The average on machine 2 was still higher so I went back to it
