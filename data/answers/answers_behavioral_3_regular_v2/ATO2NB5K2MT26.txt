I had even odds so there was no downside to picking either machine. I figured I'd see what happens if I chose the helper.
########
I won in the first round so decided to go with the helper again.
########
We won a jackpot in round two or three so the helper seemed good
########
Still winning nice numbers so kept with the helper
########
Still winning so kept with the helper (though was curious about the other machine)
########
Still winning a decent average
########
Good payout so I kept going
########
Got another nice payout so why risk it
########
Still felt like I should bet on the safe choice 
########
The average kept going up so I kept with the helper
