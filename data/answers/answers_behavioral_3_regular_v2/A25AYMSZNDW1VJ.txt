I went with the machine's guess to start off.
########
I won something, so I stuck with the same plan.
########
I wasn't winning very much so I decided to change it up.

########
I won a good amount and decided to stick with this machine.
########
I felt that I needed to pick different than the machine now and then.
########
The average was higher so I picked it.
########
I felt that going against the helper advice was not working well.
########
I went with the higher per average.
########
Decided to return to the helper's advice and test my luck.
########
The helper's advice paid off last time so I tried again.
