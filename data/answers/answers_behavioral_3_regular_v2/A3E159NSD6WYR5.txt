Since I knew nothing about either machine, I went with the helper's advice.
########
I continued with the helper's advice as it worked the previous round.
########
With a 56 cent average I continued with the helper's advice.
########
Why stop success? I continued on the current course due to the helper's advice.
########
With an average of 44 cents per pick, which seemed decent to me, I continued with the helper's advice for another round.
########
As the average has started to decrease, I am questioning the helper, but continue to use her for another round, as it seems to have been successful and I still don't know what to expect with Machine 2.
########
I was frustrated with the previous reward (I think it was .01?); I decided to gamble on Machine #2 at this point and see what its output would be like.
########
Machine 2 exceeded my expectations; I wasn't expecting a high reward. As a result, I chose it again, along with the helper's recommendation.
########
I'm becoming a bit suspicious of the helper's algorithm; I chose machine #2 again.
########
Similar to the last round, I looked at the 79 centers per pick on average statistic vs. Machine 1's average and disagreed with the helper's advice.
