I chose machine 1 because I wanted to start the game with the helper to see if it would be a good move to stick with.
########
With help I only recieved 8 cents so I thought the other machine might have a higher payout.
########
I wanted to stick with machine 2 because it seems to be paying out more.
########
I wanted to stay with this machine to see if it would continue to payout a higher amount.
########
I still wanted to stick with this machine because I seemed to be doing ok on it. 
########
The payout on machine 2 was $0 so I didnt want to take another chance of getting another $0 so I swithced machines.
########
I decided to stick with the helper because it seemed to working better.  I didn't get another $0.
########
I wanted to give machine 2 another try.
########
I thought machine 2 was going to have a big payout.
########
I wanted to use the helper because I wasn't really doing that great on my own.
