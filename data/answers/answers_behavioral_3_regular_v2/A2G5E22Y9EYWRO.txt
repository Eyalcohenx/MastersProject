Neither machine had any picks yet to go off, so it was easy to just go with helper and take the higher equity
########
after getting 0.40 on the first one the 41 cents felt underwhelming. Decided to take a shot at a 200 cent jackpot or something nice on other machine
########
At round 3 I'm starting to realize half a cent is a good round and trying to avoid the 19 average and just roll with the recommended at 41 average
########
Once again, the 19 number kind of dissuaded me
########
This machine seemed like a pretty safe 30-60 cents, scared of the 19
########
Sold by the solid 50 average
########
At this point I'm realizing there's probably a huge jackpot in the second machine at some point, but I might have already missed it in one of the last two rounds, so might as well go for the .45
########
Felt like 30-35 cents at the floor was pretty solid. Hoping for .60 or .70
########
At this point I'm really tempted to start going Machine 2 every time because I'm expecting 6-6 soon and want a shot at a big reward. But I'm also worried about reverse psychology
########
I now can't help myself, I need to attempt 3 or 4 rounds in a row avoiding the advice, because I'm basically confident the recommendation won't get me above 50 cents in a round
