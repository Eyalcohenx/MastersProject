I figured to start off I would choose the helper's advice
########
I won and decided to again choose the helper's advice
########
Since I won, I decided to choose again based on the helper's advice.
########
By now I was just curious by how many times I'd get what I considered a good reward
########
To change things up. I wanted to see if the 2nd machine would give me a better on average reward or not
########
I was rewarded well so I decided to stick with that machine. 
########
I was going on the average since the second machine seemed to be paying out better.
########
Again, it was more so based on averages
########
I decided to go with the 2nd machine until the averages evened out, if they did at all.
########
Again, even though some of the payouts were not as high, the average on machine #2 were better.
