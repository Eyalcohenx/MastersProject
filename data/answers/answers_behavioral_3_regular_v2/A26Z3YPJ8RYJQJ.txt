i picked it because it was the first machine, i didnt pick it because it was the helper's advice
########
i picked randomly, i like to play random in games
########
I did well on the one before, so I picked it again
########
I did well on the spin before so I picked it again
########
i thought that the luck would run out on the other one
########
because the last spin was low, i thought maybe it would be a higher payout
########
i thought because the luck wasn't that great it would give a payout
########
i felt like i committed to this machine and hoping it would pay out
########
I thought i would have luck with this machine
########
i picked it because i felt like it would pay out eventually
