Even though it's a helper it could be misleading me
########
Assuming that the last time I scored big from going opposite of the helper the next time the helper would have the higher amount
########
My surgery is that if I pick the helper once then I would go back and choose against the helper so I chose the helper
########
I think the helper has helped too much 
########
Back and forth 50/50 either or
########
I know it's labeled the helper but I don't trust it
########
Going against the helper seem to pay off so I did it again

########
Give the helper a shot to prove to prove me wrong
########
Seemed like not using the helper is helping
########
Reverse psychology or decision-making. Just doing the opposite of what I just didn't really
