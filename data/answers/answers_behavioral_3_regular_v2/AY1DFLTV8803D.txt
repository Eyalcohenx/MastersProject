At this point I have no knowledge of either machine, so I figured I might as well go with the recommendation.
########
The first round got me a good reward, so I stuck with it to see if it happened again.
########
Machine 1 was still giving a good payout, so I stuck with it.
########
The previous reward from machine 1 was lower than before, and I was also curious about how much machine 2 would pay out.
########
Machine 2 gave a relatively low payout, so I went back to machine 1, which had a better track record.
########
Machine 1 continued to give pretty good payouts.
########
Machine 1's previous payout was rather low, so I went back to Machine 2 to see if I could get something higher from it.
########
Machine 2 continued to give low payouts, so I went back to machine 1.
########
Machine 1 gave another low payout, so I gave machine 2 a third chance.
########
Machine 2 gave a better payout, but machine 1 still had a better track record so I went back to it.
