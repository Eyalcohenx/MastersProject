I think the helper knows best so I picked hers every time
########
I was a roll when listening to the helper
########
The helper hadn't let me down so far
########
I kept winning by listening to the helper
########
Again, helper hasn't let me down yet
########
The helper knows better than I do
########
The helper kept helping me win
########
The helper felt like they had been correct so far
########
The helper was trying to help, and was helping 
########
The helper helped me make the right choices in all the previous rolls.
