It was the first round so I took the helpers advice
########
I won 75 cents so I wanted to try again
########
I wanted to see what the other machine would pay out
########
I wanted to get a few picks in on the other machine so I could compare which was actually paying more
########
I thought it might pay more since I had been picking the other machine for a few rounds
########
The other machine seemed to be paying larger amounts
########
I wanted to try the other machine again
########
The other seemed to have a higher reward
########
I thought the other was better
########
I thought I would switch for this round
