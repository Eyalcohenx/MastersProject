Since we were just starting out I had to pick one or the other, so went with the helper's advice just to get things started.
########
I'd chosen the helper's machine in the first round, just for purposes of data gathering I selected the other to see what the outcome would be.
########
Still data gathering, I went back with the helper's advice.
########
So far I'm alternating between machines, trying to see if the one the helper recommends is really the right one.
########
Both of the last two picks were disappointing. At this point the difference between the two machines is not very great, so I'm still trying to figure out what's best.
########
Kind of continuing the theme, I'm alternating machines at this point to try and find a reward pattern.
########
The helper's advice seems to be reliable in that their machine provides a better reward on average, so I'm going to start trusting it.
########
One last check to see if the other machine is better than the helper's.
########
I believe this is the point I decided to stop investigating and just trust the helper's advice.
########
I'm locked in on the helper's machine now, that's why I picked it.
