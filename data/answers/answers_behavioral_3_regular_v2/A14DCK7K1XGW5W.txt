I just trusted the helper's pick.
########
I had no reason to not trust the helper's advice.
########
Trusted the helper's pick since he knew which one paid more on average.
########
Once again, I just put my faith in the helper, since he knew the averages.
########
I continued to trust the helper.
########
I wanted to see how low the other machine was paying, since the one I was using was supposed to have a higher average.
########
I had a really good pick on machine 2, so I just went with it again.
########
I thought maybe the payouts were starting to get higher, so I went back to the other machine and followed the helper's advice this time. It was not.
########
I went back to machine 2 because machine 1 seemed lower again, and machine 2 was paying off higher.
