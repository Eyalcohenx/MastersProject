I took the helper's suggestion
########
The helper's suggestion was not at all useful.
########
I tried to see how the helper helped
########
The helper had fulfilled my expectation
########
The helper suggested the other machine which I did not like
########
I did good with my decision
########
I had faith on my decision
########
I tried to go by my feelings
########
I was wrong in the earlier step
########
This time the helper's suggestion worked.
