It was random as neither machine had been picked previously.
########
I thought the helper knew best.
########
That was a high win per pick.
########
It was still a high cent per click so I kept going with it.
########
I was curious as to what the second machine would earn since I had not picked it in four rounds.
########
It now had the higher cent per click based on the average.
########
I didn't have a problem with the high cent per click so I kept going with it.
########
It was a good last round so I kept it going.
########
The last round was a dud so I kept with the second machine.
########
I just wanted to pick with the helper this time.
