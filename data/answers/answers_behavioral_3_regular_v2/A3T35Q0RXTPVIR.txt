I was told that the helper knew the probability of the outcome and therefore it was best to take her advice into consideration and so I went with her advice.
########
Again, I was given the impression that using the helper's advice was the best best, and I also got a decent payout using this machine the first time.
########
I got two wins with this machine, and felt it was still best to go with the advice.
########
Once again, I got a decent payout and felt it was a safe bet to continue relying on this machine.
########
I continued to feel that relying on this machine was the best option based on the helper's advice and the payouts I was getting.
########
Once again, based on the payouts I was getting, I felt it best to continue relying on the helper's advice.
########
I was already satisfied with the bonus I'd received, but knew I would likely get even more if I continued to use this machine based on past outcomes. 
########
Once again, I was still getting was I believed to be decent payouts with this machine and therefore elected to continue using it.
########
I felt certain that I would soon run out of rounds to play, so I elected to stick with the same machine, knowing it would likely give me a reasonable payout. 
########
The machine continued to give me payouts that I liked, so I continued to stick with the helper's advice.
