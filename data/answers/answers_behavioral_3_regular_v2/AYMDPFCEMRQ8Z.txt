I had no info yet, might as well choose machine 1
########
Needed at least some info on machine 2
########
So far, 88>42, so I picked machine 2 again
########
(I'm ignoring the helper, they know the odds, but they are not out to help me).  Want more info on machine 1.
########
Machine 2 seems to have better odds, I'm trying to maximize my winnings
########
Still trying to max my $
########
The 4 cent on last round makes me think maybe the 2 machines are close in odds, checking 1 again
########
Ave still better on 2, I'm just going to stick with it
########
Same as before - Ave still better on 2, I'm just going to stick with it
########
With 3 picks on 1 so far and 6 on machine 2, that's enough for me to be confident enough to just stick with 2.
