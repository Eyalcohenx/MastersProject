helper knows the machines payout so i decided to just try it. 
########
the payout was quite good. i don't know what the max payout is so 36 seemed like a good number. better than a losing.
########
the payout grew, and that seemed pretty good. i am still making money.
########
payout still seems positive so i will continue to try. I haven't hit a negative payout yet.
########
my average is starting to go down. but it's still positive. that is still okay.
########
i am very concerned since my wins are very small now. But it is still positive.
########
My winnings were so small that I thought i should try the other machine. While it's all random, i thought i may have a different sort of luck on the other machine. if it didn't pay well, i cold always come back.
########
at this point i don't really care about the helper's advice.  The payout was very high. way higher than the other machine. I was wondering if this was just a fluke or is this a better paying machine. makes me wonder who the helper was helpig.
########
the payout previously was quite good, being that i am not caring about the helper anymore,i am just going off of my experience.
########
the average win on machine 2 is still higher than on machine 1. I am ignoring the helper's advice and still going off my experience.
