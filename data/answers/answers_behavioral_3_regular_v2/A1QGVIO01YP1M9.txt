I wanted to follow the helper at the start.
########
I assumed the helper knew best.
########
I assumed the helper would still be correct.
########
I found it odd the helper kept making the same choice and wanted to experiment.
########
the average was higher on 2 and the helper implied it was a better choice.
########
The helper swapping back to 1 made me want to as well.
########
The last round worked out, so I decided to follow the helper yet again and see how it goes.
########
The helper did not pay out as well last round, and I had a feeling it might not actually be making the best choice due to the low payout of the previous round.
########
The helper still remaining on 1 was interesting, and the last round did not make it seem like the helper was intentionally lying so I figured following the helper this round couldn't hurt.
########
The machine's average were evening out, and the helper telling me 1 was still the best choice made me think 1 might pay out big soon.
