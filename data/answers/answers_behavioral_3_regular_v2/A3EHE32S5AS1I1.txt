No previous knoledge, so since helper has more information, it seems wiser to listen to it
########
Helpers got more information, so it is wiser to follow it's advise
########
The results are not really good but the helper information its still there, so it is wiser to follow it's advise
########
I wanted to try the other possible choice, since the cost of a mistake it's not high, even knowing that it is against the logic.
########
I had a little proof about the helper's "good will" since I tried the other option and the result was lower than any of the previous results from the helper's choice.
########
I decided to continue following helper's choice from now on, cause statistically it should be better
########
Even when the results doesnt seem good, in random games statistics must be followed to maximize the benefit.
########
In a long term, with enough number of plays, if I keep playing the option statistically better, it will mean a better result.
########
I may have some doubts, since the helper can be designed to have bad intentions, or beein deceivefull. However, with the information that I have, the only way to test that is play a lot of "unrecomended" choices and make a short statistical study myself.
########
I start regretting not having tried both option for a few times to test if the helper is good intentioned or not. But picking a couple times the second choice would not give me a lot of info at this point, so I decide to keep up with the original plan and follow helper's advice
