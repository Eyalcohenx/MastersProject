it was the first pick, so i decided to trust the helper as I had no information of my own.
########
wanted to see how the first machine paid, and it was still recommended by the helper
########
helper still recommended machine 1, and it was paying pretty well.
########
i wanted to see how the other machine paid since i got a few rolls from the first machine already.
########
wanted to test the second machine again and give it a few test picks
########
the first machine seemed to be paying better so i went with that one
########
first machine was still paying better, so i was going for more money.
########
i had hope in the first machine still because the helper was still recommending it
########
decided that the second machine might be the one paying better, so i gave it another chance
########
the second machine's average shot up a lot, so i wanted to keep pushing it
