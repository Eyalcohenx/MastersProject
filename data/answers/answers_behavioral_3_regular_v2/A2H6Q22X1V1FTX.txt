I was told the helper knew about higher payoffs and chose to believe this
########
I continued to believe that it knew better payouts and decided not to alter my actions 
########
I continued with my previous logic believing that the helper had pre knowledge of the payouts 
########
I thought the payouts were a little low and decided to try the other option
########
The previous payout was higher than the previous three combined so I stayed with the one the helper did not choose .
########
The payout was good from the previous choice to not side with the helper do I continued that choice. 
########
My choice to not sure with the helper deemed to be paying higher returns so I continued. 
########
I reconsidered as the previous payout was low and went back to the helper's recommendation.
########
I wanted to check as I thought perhaps the recommendation system could be a fabrication 
########
The average for each spin was getting closer so I decided to switch back to the recommendation.
