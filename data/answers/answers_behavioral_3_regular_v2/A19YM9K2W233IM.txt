It seemed like the obvious choice. I mean why wouldn't I pick the one the helper is reccomending? They're getting a bonus if I pick that one right? I kept with the advice after getting good spins from it anyway, why switch if it's putting out?
########
Same as before, it seemed obvious and it put out.
########
By this point I'm like ok, this is definitely the hot machine. 
########
I stuck with this one, but considered trying the other to see what it would do. Ultimately I stuck with the advice.
########
The average started going down, but I figured I'd stuck with it this far, keep going with it.
########
I said to myself "if the next one is bad, switch to the other one." but If I'm not mistaken, the next few were really good.
########
With the average slightly going back up, I figure it'd hover around here so pretty much after this no matter what I'm sticking with the helpers advice.
########
Back down again but I wasn't budging. Sticking with the advice.
########
Again, just sticking with the advice to be on the safe side.
########
Average up a good bit, at this point I'm like "This is definitely the machine" and waited for the good hits.
