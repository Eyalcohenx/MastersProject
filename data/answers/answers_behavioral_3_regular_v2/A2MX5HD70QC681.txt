With no data, I went with the recommendation.
########
I wanted to see what the other machine gave.
########
I wanted to get some more information about the yields of machine 2.
########
I would have stuck with machine 2 anyway, to get more data.
########
Again, wanted more data -- and it was interesting that the helper's recommendation was now coinciding with mine.
########
I had gotten such good results with machine 2 and wanted to get more data.
########
I thought I had enough to see a meaningful average from machine 2, now time to switch back to machine 1 and get data (and again, interesting that the helper's decision coincided with mine, but that wasn't what I based it on).
########
Sticking with this one to get more data/meaningful average.
########
Again, wanted more data (and following the helper).
########
Wanted more data. Their averages were drawing much closer.
