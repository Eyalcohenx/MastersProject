I went with helper's advice since it was the first time.
########
I picked the machine that hadn't been picked yet.
########
I got a higher reward so I stayed with machine 2.
########
I stayed with the one with the higher reward.
########
Machine 1 had higher rewards for the 2 picks.
########
I wanted to switch it up and not always take the helper's advice.
########
I had already picked machine 2 4 times and wanted to go back to machine 1 because I had only picked it 2 times.
########
I was getting bigger rewards on machine 1.
########
The rewards were higher on machine 1.
########
I had picked machine 1 5 times and machine 2 only 4 times.
