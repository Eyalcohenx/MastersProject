I feel that the helper had no reason to do me wrong and was trying to help so I went with their pick.
########
Again I felt the helper was trying to help so I went with their choice.
########
Things had worked out so far so I had no reason not to continue with their recommendation.
########
I felt like I was accumulating some rewards and decided to continue taking the helper's recommendation.
########
Things were still going well so I continued to take their advice.
########
Again, things were going well so why stop?
########
I was beginning to wonder about the other machine, but felt things were going well still.
########
Another nice return and average so I decided to continue taking their advice.
########
The last spin paid nothing so I wanted to give the other machine a try.
########
I did not like the other machine's return so I decided the helper's advice was best.
