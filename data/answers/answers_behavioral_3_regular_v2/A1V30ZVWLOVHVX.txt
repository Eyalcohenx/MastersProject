I wanted to go with my first choice, as a gut instinct.
########
For round two, I wanted to see what the net outcome would be between two rounds of machine number one.
########
Then I wanted to compare between machine one and machine two, to see which would give me a higher payout.
########
On machine two, I won 90 cents, so I decided to go again and felt like I was going to get a higher average than one.
########
Then after recieving more cents on machine two, I decided to go again because that was going to net me more coins.
########
After three rounds on machine two, I went back to machine one to see if the average would increase suddenly between three picks.
########
I chose machine one again, to see if I could increase the pot in four picks, rather than three.
########
I went back to machine two to see if I could win more on average in four picks and it felt like I could.
########
I went back to machine one because I had rolled on machine two quite a bit, and wanted to even them out.
########
I chose machine one again because it was giving me slightly higher rewards, and to even it out with machine two.
