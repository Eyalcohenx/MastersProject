I believed them and clicked the recommended one.
########
I was curious what the other one would give me.
########
I chose it because it still offered high amounts
########
I continued to choose the higher machine.
########
I tried the first one again to see if it was better now.
########
I went back to the other machine that I felt had a higher average payout.
########
I stayed with the machine i liked.
########
I continued to stay with the machine i believed was better
########
I tried the original one when I got a very low point score from machine two.

I continued to select machine 1 since it was doing better.
