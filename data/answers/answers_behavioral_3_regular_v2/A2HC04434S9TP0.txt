It was highlighted and seemed bigger (better rewards)
########
I liked the reward so I continued
########
The reward was still very good
########
The reward increased do there was no reason to change
########
The machine was still giving a good reward
########
There was a slightly decrease in the reward
########
I came back to helper's advice looking for the previous rewards
########
It was not what I expected so I changed
########
Seemed an obvious choice. The reward would be bigger
########
I was hopping the the same machine would reward me more
