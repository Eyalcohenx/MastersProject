Neither machine had been picked yet, so I went with the helper's advice.
########
I wanted to see if this machine would continue to win.
########
I figured the helper knew which machine was likely to pay out, and so went with the helper's advice.
########
Same as before: this machine continued to pay out.
########
I wanted to see what would happen with the other machine.
########
The second machine had a higher average payout.
########
The second machine still had the higher average payout.
########
I wanted to even out the number of picks for each machine to get a true sense of the average.
########
Now that both machines had a 4-pick average, I trusted in the helper.
########
The second machine still had the higher average.
