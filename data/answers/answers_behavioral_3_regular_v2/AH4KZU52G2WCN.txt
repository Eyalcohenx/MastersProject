I went with the helpers advice to see what happened
########
I noticed the helper was choosing that machine based on me only
########
I decided to go with the helper one more time, but the winnings were getting low
########
I went with my gut feeling and it worked, I got a higher payout
########
I chose two again because it had given me a good payout
########
I went back to 1 and it didn't work very well
########
So I went for number two again and they payout was pretty good
########
Machine 1 had been giving me good payouts
########
I decided to stick with the helpers advice in hopes for higher payouts
########
Again I went my own way because the payouts with the helper were low
