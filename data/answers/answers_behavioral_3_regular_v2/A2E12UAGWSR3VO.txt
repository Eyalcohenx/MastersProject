I started off by choosing what the helper recommended, as I assumed it might be what gives me a better reward.
########
After getting 20 cents from the helper's I had no idea if this was higher or lower than machine 2. To get my bearings, I chose machine number 2.
########
Because my reward was more than 2 times higher on machine 2 than 1, I decided to pick it again to see if I'd get another high one.
########
Now that I knew Machine 2 gave me on average 38 cents compared to 20 for 1, I selected 1 again to have a comparable 2 events and see the averages.
########
After picking 1 last round, I got such a low reward I realized OK probably the better machine is 2, the helper gets rewarded for advising 1, and I should really just start picking 2 from now on to maximize my earning potential.
########
Again, as I see my average from picking 2 maintain around the 40-50 cent mark, I kept picking it.
########
Another solid round from 2 bringing my average even higher to 54 cents, so I selected again.
########
Same thing as before, selecting 2 to maximize earnings.
########
Again wanted to maximize rewards so selected 2
########
2 continued to produce so I selected again
