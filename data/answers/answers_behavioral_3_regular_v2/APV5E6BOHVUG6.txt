Control, Picking either didnt really matter
########
Wanted to see how second roll compared to first
########
Need to compare how other machine preformed
########
Back to first machine, result was low
########
Tested recommended machine, trying to determine which one is better now
########
Testing Recommended pick again. Average winnings seem low
########
Back to testing second machine.
########
Machine two seems like the best option now round for round
########
Machine two continues to out preform machine one
########
Now believe helper is either random or purposefully picking lowest machine.
