I thought maybe the helper works for the casino and wants me to choose the machine that pays less.
########
I was happy with the first reward so I didn't see a reaon to change machines.
########
Machine 2 seemed to be giving me good results.
########
I like the results from machine 2.
########
Machine 2 results have been good so I don't want to change.
########
Machine 2 is giving good results.
########
I like machine 2 so I am not curious about machine 1.
########
I think the maximum bonus is $1 and since I am halfway there I would rather stay with machine 2.
########
I never did trust the helper so I want to stay with machine 2.
########
Who pays the helpers reward if I choose machine 1? - The casino? I don't trust the helper's advice.
