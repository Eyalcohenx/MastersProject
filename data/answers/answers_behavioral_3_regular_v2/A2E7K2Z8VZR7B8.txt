Start with the helper to get a better understanding on the possibilities around this game mechanism.
########
Now that I got the helper's info wanted to compare without it's help to know how much I would gain.
########
Having won more with the helper than without it, back to the helper.
########
Felt like the helper's advice didn't give enough return as I expected so I choose to go without it.
########
Got a higher amount than expected without the helper and decided to keep going without his help.
########
The return without the helper dissatisfied me and decided to go back to it again since it's been 7 cents more per-pick on average.
########
Helper felt like it wasn't a good choice and with only 1 cent per-pick more didn't think it was much of an advantage to use the helper.
########
Got distrusted by the helper so kept betting against it.
########
Same stuff where I kept betting against the helper cause it felt like it was working.
########
With a 50/50 and both returns equally, decided that since I've bet against him constantly should give him another try.
