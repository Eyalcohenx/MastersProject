I had no basis to go on so I went ahead with the helper's choice.

I got a nice reward the first time so I decided to try this machine again.
########
The second pull wasn't a great reward so I decided to try machine 2.
########
I got a nice reward on machine 2 so I decided to try it again.
########
I got a low payout on the last pull with machine 2 so I tried my luck back on machine 1.
########
I wasn't happy with the reward I got with the machine 1 pull so I went back to trying machine 2.
########
I was happy enough with the reward on machine 2 so I went again with it. At this point I was kind of basing it off of more than or less than a 50 cent payoff to continue with the machine.
########
I has another unlucky pull on machine 2 so I went back to machine 1.
########
I believe this one was exactly 50 cents so I decided to try again since the helper was still recommending it.
########
I got another low reward on machine 1 so I went back to trying machine 2.
