Helper benefits from my choices so I assumed the help would be beneficial to me.
########
I wanted to see what happens when I chose the other machine
########
Big win in previous round made me think I can do it again
########
I looked at the average. The bonus was the helper picked the higher average machine.
########
I trusted helper in this round to get higher pay off
########
I chose this one randomly
########
The average winnings were higher than machine one
########
The higher average was with machine 1 and this was also helper recommendation. 
########
The higher average plus helper recommendation 
########
I figured helper can help maximize the winning.
