I had no way of knowing so I decided to go with the helper's advice.
########
My first reward was decent so I saw no reason not to stick with the helper's advice.

########
I was starting to feel confident that this was going to be a steady, low payout but decent payout machine.
########
Wanted to stick with the security of what was starting to feel like a known reward amount (in the 20 cents range).
########
Didn't want to give up on something that seemed to be working.
########
I felt like I'd earned something (140 virtual cents) and it was okay to take a wild gamble on the other machine even though it wasn't recommended.
########
This was a large award so I decided to stick with the new machine and I liked that this was now also the helper's advice.
########
Now the averages are about the same so I feel like it's totally up to chance again and have decided I don't trust the helper.
########
I feel like machine 2 is riskier but it yields a significantly higher reward 50% of the time so it's worth it.
########
Machine number 2 has a much higher average now and seems like the better machine.
