I didn't want to take a risk for low reward, so I decided to pick the machine the helper chose in order to get an understanding of the game.
########
Even though the reward output was low (8 cents), I decided to go with the helper's recommendation.
########
There seemed to be little risk in my decision at this point, so I kept going with the helper's advice.
########
Given the huge award's I've won as a result of the helper's advice, I continued to stick to their recommendation.
########
I felt like the helper had my best intentions in mind.
########
There was no doubt in my mind to continue with the recommendations of the helper, I did not want to risk lower points.
########
Because of the helper's intuition, I'd already earned a fair helping of points. I wasn't going to change that.
########
The helper really had a knack for what was the best decision, I had full faith in them.
########
I just decided to go with my intuition, and follow the helper's recommendation.
########
Since the helper didn't change what they recommended, neither did I change which machine I chose.
