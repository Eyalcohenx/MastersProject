I honestly didn't mean to pick number 2.  I clicked on the machine but thought it was just going to give me info. I didn't realize it was a final choice.
########
I figured the helper knew better than me and I should go with the helper.
########
I was surprised that machine 1 didn't pay very well on the last round so I switched.
########
I was very please with results of last turn so stayed with 2. It didn't hurt that the helper chose it too.
########
I felt machine 2 was doing above average so I should keep going with it.
########
I was very confident that machine 2 was the best based on prior turns.
########
I started to wonder why the helper kept going with 1 so I went with 1.
########
I was happy with last outcome on 1 so I was going to give it another try.
########
Again, I kept trying to go with what the helper was recommending.
########
I had given machine 1 several turns in a row and I just wasn't satisfied with the outcomes so I switched.
