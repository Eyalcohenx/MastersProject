With no other information to go on, I took the helper's advice.  Figured to see what would happen.
########
Since the helper knew more information than me, I went with the helper, again seeing what would develop.
########
Now I have two rather different rewards on 2 picks but what seems a reasonable average.  I thought the helper would continue to advise correctly as long as the average seemed reasonable.
########
I am now thinking that the average for the other machine must be considerable lower than my working average, so I continued to stick with the helper.
########
The average is now rather steady so there is no reason to switch - I stick with the helper.
########
Slightly down, but not enough that the helper's advice switches, so I keep up with following the advice.
########
Good round here and I didn't expect the helper's advice would switch now - we just keep going as long as the overall average doesn't decrease.
########
Holding steady with the average in mid-40's.  Not expecting that the helper's advice would change and I continue to follow it.
########
Although I'm curious what would happen if I experimented with the other machine, there is no other reason to change gears and I continue following the helper.
########
The performance centers around the same performance without much variation so I stay the course and follow the helper.
