I thought that most people would go for the machine chosen by the helper, so I wanted to see what would happen if I chose the other machine. I just was trying to be opposite of what a typical Turker would be. 
########
Now I wanted to see what the difference in payout would be, so I went with machine number 1. 
########
So now I am switching back and forth to see if I could figure out which machine would have a higher payout. It looks like machine 1 has a higher payout, but I'm going to keep switching back and forth. 
########
Again, I wanted to switch back and forth to see if machine 1 really had a higher payout. 
########
Again, I was switching back and forth. So now machine 2 has the higher average based on 2 picks each. But that didn't necessarily mean that the helper was advising me to pick the machine with the highest payout. The helper was going to get more just if I chose the machine they recommended. I was trying to figure out the highest pay for myself. 
########
Again, I'm switching back and forth to see if there is a pattern or if I can tell which machine has a higher payout. 
########
Hmmm. So now the average is the same. So I don't know which machine has the highest payout. 
########
I'm still going back and forth. It looks like machine 1 may have a higher payout?  I don't remember if I stopped going back and forth or if I just went with machine 1 after this turn. 
########
I guess I continued to switch back and forth. Machine 1 is not looking so good right now. 
########
So it looks like machine 1 has the higher average. I'm not sure if I stopped switching back and forth or not.
