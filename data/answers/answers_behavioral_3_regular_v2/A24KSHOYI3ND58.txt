Choosing the helper's choice felt like a safe bet...as though it ensured I would win a decent amount of money.
########
I chose to stay with the helper's advice because it, again, felt safe...a sure thing.
########
At this point, choosing the helper's choice became a habit. I noticed the winnings were decreasing, but I didn't want to take a chance on Machine 2.
########
Again, habit. I was winning, not as much as in the beginning, but still winning. I had become complacent.
########
Machine 1 was a safe bet, however the diminishing returns began to wear on me.
########
I decided to give Machine 1 another try in hopes the reward amount would increase. It didn't increase.
########
I wanted to see if I could win more money (I thought I changed machines in round #6). Even if the amount won was less than Machine 1 offered, I had to take the chance that Machine #2 would return more.
########
Machine 2 paid out more than Machine 1! My gamble was successful, so now I realized that it seemed that both machines start out with large rewards and then the following turns would reveal less and less money.
########
Machine 2 was true to the pattern (high initial return, diminishing returns thereafter). I opted to stay with Machine 2 until the reward returned below 40.
########
The return remained good for Machine 2. I opted to continue to use until the return hit about/around 40.
