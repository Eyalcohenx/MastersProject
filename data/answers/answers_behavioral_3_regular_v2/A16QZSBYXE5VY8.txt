Well, as this was my 1st try, I trusted the helper, after reading the text.
########
In here also trusted the helper. But was already a but curious.
########
Wanted to try the other machine. Helper had 2 picks only. And wanted to check, what the other machine will give me.
########
24 cents for 2 picks-> Went for the other machine, just seeking for luck.
########
Was feeling lucky and hoped, that the other machine is better. Helper had 16 cents as average.
########
3 picks and 16 cents average-> the other machine seemed a right choice and it really was.
########
Here again-> the other machine looked more attractive. 55 cents vs. 16 cents and 3 picks for bothe. And thanks goes to the 2nd machine.
########
The other machine seems to be "more giving", so I made my choice based on that.
########
The other machine here has more "experience", this is why I chose that.
########
Here again-> the 2nd machine seems to be better. More stats.
