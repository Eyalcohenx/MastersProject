Since I didn't have any information of my own yet, I went with the helper's reccommendation
########
I did okay on the first turn so I decided to use the same machine since the helper still recommended it
########
I wanted to see what would happen if I chose the other machine
########
I chose the helper recommendation twice so I thought it would be a good idea to try the other machine twice to see if I agreed with the helper
########
Machine 1 had a higher average than machine two after two turns on each
########
Machine 1 had the higher average and the helper recommendation so I thought it would be the better choice
########
The machine's average was lowering but I still thought it was best
########
The past couple of rounds had been bad so I switched to the other machine to see if it was any better
########
The last round, machine 2 did really well so I chose it again
########
The previous round went badly and I thought it likely that machine 2's big prizes were higher than machine 1 but that the low prizes were also much lower, so Machine 1 would be better because it would give me pretty consistent middling prizes
