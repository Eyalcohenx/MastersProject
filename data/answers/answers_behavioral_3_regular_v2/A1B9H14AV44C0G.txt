This was the first round of the game and I chose to take the advice of the helper.
########
I wanted to see the value of the other slot machine to see if it was higher than the value I accumulated by selecting the machine the helper suggested. 
########
After the last round I got the impression the helper was making a suggestion that was beneficial to him or her because the slot machine that was not recommended had a higher value. 
########
I felt the slot machine that was not suggested by the helper contained a higher value. 
########
The value of the machine opposite the machine suggested by the helper had a low value so I wanted to see if perhaps the helper had begun to give advice that would be beneficial to me. 
########
I felt the machine the helper suggested had a value that was lower on average. I figured the opposite machine would sometimes have a lower value but was the most beneficial overall. 
########
I continued to use the machine opposite the one suggested by the helper because it had a higher value overall. 
########
I chose the machine I felt was most beneficial to me, which was opposite the machine suggested by the helper. 
########
I wanted to test and see if perhaps the value of the machine suggested by the helper had improved.
########
I went back to the machine I felt had the greatest value and was most beneficial to me.
