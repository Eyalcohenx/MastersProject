I figured I would trust the helper and see how it went.
########
The first round went well so why not trust with the second round.
########
I figured at this point I probably will select the helper each time.
########
I don't have any clue as to which one to pick so choosing the helper just makes sense.
########
I am sticking with what seems to be working.
########
I like not having to think for myself.
########
This seems like a no brainer.
########
I am happy to have a helper.
########
I wish I always had a helper.
########
I am going with what I know to be working.
