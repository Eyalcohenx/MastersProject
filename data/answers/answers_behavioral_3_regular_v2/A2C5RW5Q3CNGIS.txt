I figured I would give the recommended option a try to get a feel for what would happen.

It went well in the first round so I tried again to see if there would be a difference.

Even though I figured it might change, I decided to stick with what had been working.

I thought that the "Helper" wouldn't be likely to change recommendation once my choices had shown some consistency.

########
I saw no reason to change when there were only two choices and it had worked so far to stick with the first one.
########
It would have seemed silly at this point to change, since I could have had no way of knowing that the second option was better at this point.
########
I decided not to mess with what had been working.
########
Same reason as before; it had worked so far so I stuck with it.
########
No new reason; I stuck with what had worked.
