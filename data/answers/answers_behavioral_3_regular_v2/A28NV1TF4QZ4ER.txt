For the first round I decided to take the helper's advice since I didn't know what was going to happen and I had no idea what the odds were for each machine
########
I felt I did well on the first round so I chose to continue with the first machine
########
I was curious to see the payout of the second machine
########
I figured I could continue to play following the helper's advice
########
I figured I could continue per the helper's advice
########
I figured I could continue per the helper's advice again
########
I didn't seem to be doing as well on the helper's advice so I wanted to switch it up
########
Back to the helper's advice since both machine's were performing similarly
########
Same as before, continuing to take the helper's advice
########
Again continuing to take the helper's advice
