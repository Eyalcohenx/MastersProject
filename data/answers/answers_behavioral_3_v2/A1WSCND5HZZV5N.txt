This was my first pick, so I chose the one the helper suggested.

I continued to choose what the helper suggested, especially because I won points before.
########
I again went with the helpers choice because I felt the track record was good.
########
It seemed to be working so I went with the helper's choice.
########
At this point I was just too curious not to try the other option to see if I was missing anything. 
########
The first time I used machine 2 had a good payoff so I chose it again.
########
I had been having luck with machine 2, so chose to go against the helper and remain there. 
########
It seemed to me the overall payoffs were higher on this machine.
########
I think the overall average had been better for me on choice 2 so I stuck with it. 
########
I was having luck on machine 2.
