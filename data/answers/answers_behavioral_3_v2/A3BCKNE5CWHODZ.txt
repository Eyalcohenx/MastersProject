I figured since neither of the machines had been picked yet that I should start with the recommended one.
########
I wanted to have 2 rounds so that I would have an average of what was awarded on that one
########
I wanted to see what the other machine would turn out regardless of the recommendation
########
I was impressed with the winning and wanted to see if it would happen again
########
I wanted to see if number 1 would give a lower winning again and if it would be higher since the helper recommended it
########
I wasn't impressed with number one on the last spin so I picked the number 2 as it pays higher
########
again still impressed with the higher turn out and confused as to why the helper is saying to pick the other one
########
curiosity and a gamble to see if the recommendation is accurate
########
was disappointed again with number 1 so went back to number 2
########
the helper is wrong and number 2 is the better machine
