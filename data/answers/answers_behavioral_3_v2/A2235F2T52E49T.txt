first round, went with helper's advice since have zero data about both machines yet
########
Want to try out machine 2 for the first time to test the payout
########
Much higher payout from machine 2 compared to machine 1, decided to spin machine 2 again to test variance
########
Decided to follow helper's advice as average payout is much higher machine 1
########
Decided to test roll machine 1 to get more observations in for considering which machine has a higher average payout ratio
########
Does not make sense for helper to still recommend machine 1 when cents per-pick on average is much lower compared to machine 2, believes helper has interest if I pick machine 1
########
not trusting helper anymore, appears machine 2 has a higher average payout
########
believes helper is biased towards machine 1, chose machine 2 over machine 1 more than twice the number of times and still coming out with a higher average payout
########
Remembered rolled a two cents payout from machine 2 a round or two ago, think it is possible machine 2 does have a larger variance compared to machine 1, decided to test machine 1 to see if it will roll a large payout at least in the 50-cents or above range
########
Average cents per pick payout on machine 1 still very low compared to machine 2, convinced that machine 2 has a better payout ratio than machine 1
