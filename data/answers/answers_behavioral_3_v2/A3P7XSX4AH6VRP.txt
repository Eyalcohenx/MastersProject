I figured I go with the sure thing
########
helper was right the first round so i figured i'd let it roll
########
I was on a roll so i kept it going
########
why stop when its going good
########
good streak going so i kept it up
########
still making money so i picked helper machine again
########
i wasnt going to but i figured as long as i was winning why not
########
for a while i was winning nicely then i got 2 cents figured it was time to switch up
########
honestly i was excited and i didnt notice the helper had switched
########
i have absolutely no idea
