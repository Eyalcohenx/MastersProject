Wanted to start off in a somewhat 'safe' mode, so went with the helper.
########
Wanted to see what the other machine was paying out.
########
Helper choice didn't influence my decision, the machine seemed to pay out more so went with it again.
########
Helpers recommendation didn't sway me, the previous pick paid out well, so kept going with it.
########
Helpers recommendation is still paying to low, the previous pick paid out well, so kept going with it.
########
Wanted to see if there was any uptick in the payout
########
Felt that machine 2 was the better choice, the average was still much higher.
########
Same as previous, just went with the higher average
########
Still feeling machine 2 will pay better
########
Decided to chance the helpers recommendation one more time. paid ok, but still lower
