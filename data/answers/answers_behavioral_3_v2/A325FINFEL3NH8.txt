i choose machine 1 because i thought it would give me more bonus cents
########
as soon as machine 1 showed me lower bonus i skipped to choose machine 2 
########
i won 77 cents means more bonus 
########
again i opted for machine 1 thinking i would get more bonus
########
again opted more bonus so i stayed back at machine 1 
########
i thought of getting hundred cents on machine 2 
########
thought of getting 100 cents in this round
########
thought of getting 100 cents at one round
########
it showed me lower cent so switched to machine 1 
########
stayed back at machine 1 for getting more bonus
