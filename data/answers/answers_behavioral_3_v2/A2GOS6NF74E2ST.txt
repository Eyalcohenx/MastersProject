I wanted to see if the helper would guide me accurately
########
My round 1 reward sucked but I wanted to see if this time would be better
########
Machine 1 was horrible, so I decided to try Machine 2
########
I ignored the helper and chose machine 2 for the high pay off
########
Machine 2 has paid off more than machine 1 so I want to stick with it
########
I still prefer machine 2 over machine 1
########
Machine 2 started giving me smaller rewards so I went back to see if machine 1 would be better
########
Machine 1 gave me a low pay off so I went back to machine 2
########
I still prefer machine 2 even though it's been giving me less than it originally did
########
Machine 2 started giving me bad returns so I tried machine 1 again
