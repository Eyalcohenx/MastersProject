I chose this machine to see what the rewards were since it was recommended by the helper. It seemed that adopting her advice would gain me more points. 
########
This machine continued to give high payoffs so I kept selecting it.
########
I decided to try the other machine to see if it also gave a good reward.
########
This machine was paying better.
########
The other machine seemed to periodically pay well so I picked it for this round. 
########
I should have picked the helper recommendation but wanted to test my idea on if the other machine was actually a better machine.
########
Machine 1 seemed to be paying more. 
########
The helper recommendation was paying more from prior rounds so I stayed with it. 
########
Just in case, I picked the other machine.
########
I just couldn't seem to give up the idea that maybe the helper was biased..
