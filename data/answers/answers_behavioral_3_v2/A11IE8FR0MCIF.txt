the helper knows the odds of the machine, so I decided to start with their recommendation
########
Won a decent amount the first time, so decided to try that machine again
########
On average when playing a slot you go into a losing period so I decided not to push my luck with machine 1 and give Machine 2 a try
########
Won a good amount with first spin of machine 2 so decided to try it again
########
One cant push their luck so decided to try machine 1 again
########
Did not get a good win, so went back to machine2
########
Did not win much at machine 2 so went back to machine 1
########
Decided just to stick with that machine for a round and see what happened
########
Decided to switch machines and see if i got a bigger win
########
Wasn't getting a lot from either machine at this point, randomly going with 2
