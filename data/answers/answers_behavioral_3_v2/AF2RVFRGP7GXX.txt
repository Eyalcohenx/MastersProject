The helper knew more than me about it so I figured I'd give the one the helper tried.
########
The first round with the helper yielded nothing so I thought I'd try again before I chose the opposite machine.
########
The last round yielded a decent prize so again I went with the helpers advice.
########
I wanted to see if the other machine would payout since the first round the helpers machine yielded nothing.
########
The last round had a very small prize so I went back to the helpers advice.
########
I chose to stick with the helpers advice since it seemed like it paid more
########
Again I chose to stick with a known result
########
I just chose to continue following the helpers advice as long as the payout was more than the round when I went without the helpers advice
########
Same as the last round as long as the payout had been higher than when I went against the helpers advice I continued to follow the helpers advice
########
I stuck with the helpers advice since the payout was decent
