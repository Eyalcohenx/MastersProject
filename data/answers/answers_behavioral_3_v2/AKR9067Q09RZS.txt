I decided to trust in the Helper's recommendation.
########
I thought winning 24 cents was a pretty solid reward.
########
I wanted to see whether or not the Helper's recommendation was consistent.
########
I had won around 41 cents in a previous round and wanted to see if it would increase.
########
I'm winning 34 cents on average and am not tempted to throw that success away.
########
I'm trusting that the Helper continues to know the odds better than I do.
########
I feel that possibly picking machine 2 is a trap.
########
I was tempted to see what Machine 2 had to offer.
########
I wanted to see what the average would be if I continued to pick Machine 2.
########
I feel that Machine 2 is a trap after receiving 0 cents during a previous round.
