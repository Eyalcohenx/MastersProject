Having no real feel for how either of the machines would perform I chose to follow the advice of the helper for the first round.
########
Since I won a substantial amount the first time by following the helper's advice I chose to stick with that same machine.
########
If I recall, the winnings from the previous round were less than $0.50 so I decided to try my luck with the other non-reommended machine.
########
I was pleased with the amount I won the the second machine and decided to use it a second time to see how it would work out.
########
Not only did the helper recommend the machine but I had a higher winnings total with that machine so it made sense to choose that one.
########
I followed the helper's advice because for the most part she seemed to know which machine would have the highest payout and also because my earnings on Machine #1 were somewhat higher than on Machine #2
########
I cannot remember the previous machine's payout but any time I played a machine that paid out less than $0.50 I switched to the other machine, so that is likely what I did in this round.
########
I believe the previous round must also have paid out less than $0.50 so I went again followed the helper's advice. Not only that but Machine #1 had given me greater winnings than machine #2.
########
Since the helper proved helpful with the previous round I decided I should keep following her recommendation.
########
One of my mottos in life is that if something is working, you should stay with it. As the helper was for the most part accurate in her recommendations I saw no reason to change to the other machine at this point.
