This one was just a fifty fifty chance since neither machine had been played yet.
########
I was curious to see what the other machine had to offer, still weren't many picks for the helper to know.
########
this machine seemed as though it were luckier at the time, the payouts seemed like they were more
########
the helper recommended and the cents per pick was higher
########
the cents per pick were higher on the other, and that seemed like the safer choice
########
wanted to test the helpers knowledge and cents per pick were higher
########
I was trying to see if there was any kind of pattern, or advantage of picking the helpers choice
########
was trying to find out the opposite, was there any advantage of not picking the helpers choice.
########
was mainly looking at the average cents per pick 
########
in not finding any clear pattern or clear advantage of one machine being better than the other, I just went with the helpers advice.
