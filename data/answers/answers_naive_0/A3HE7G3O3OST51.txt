This machine hadn't been played yet, so I needed to roll it to get more information. 
########
I got a high number and wanted to see if it would repeat. 
########
again, I rolled a good number of cents which was higher than the 10c average of machine 1. 
########
I was having too much good luck to switch back yet. 
########
I thought I did adopt the helper's advice? But I wanted to see if machine 1 would be good to me. 
########
Machine 1, it turned out, paid higher than machine 2. 
########
Machine 2 paid higher than machine 1, so I decided to stick with it unless it dropped below 20c on a roll. 
########
Machine 1 was highlighted by the helper. 
########
Machine one was averaging higher than machine 2. 
########
Machine 1 had a higher average than machine 2.
