Started with helper's suggestion.
########
Decided to stick with helper's suggestion despite low win on round 1.
########
With a seemingly large win in round 2, decided to stick with this machine. Supported by helper suggesting this machine.
########
Stuck with machine 1 as it had seemingly decent payouts and was helper's choice.
########
Same as before. Sticking with a winner (and suggested).
########
Yet another pull for number 1 for the same reasons as before.
########
Decided to see what the other machine was about. In hindsight, should have done this in round 2 and changed to the machine with the highest average after each round.
########
Machine 2 had a higher average, so went with that one again.
########
Still higher average for machine 2.
########
And went with higher average yet again.
