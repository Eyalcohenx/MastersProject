I chose this one because it was highlighted in yellow, like the helper was yelling at me to choose it
########
I chose the same machine because it won 79 cents and I thought it might replicate a similar payout, after all, it was recommended by the helper
########
I chose this machine again because I had luck the first two times, and again, it was recommended by the helper 
########
I chose this machine again because I felt the first 3 payouts were good, although I had no point of reference in that I had not tested the other machine. For some reason, I seem to value the helper's opinion.  But I think it being highlighted in yellow also influenced me
########
I almost chose the other machine, but decided to give  Machine 1 a try again, partly because after the last two relatively low payouts, I thought it might payout again another 79 cents but it was low again. After this one, I stopped listening to the helper. 
########
I gave up on my helper, who always seemed to choose machine 1.  I ignored the yellow. And sure enough, I got a high payout. At least, I thought it was high
########
Since I ignored the helper last time and it seemed to pay off, I did it again and chose Machine 2, just to see what would happen
########
Again, I chose to ignore the helper and the yellow and go for Machine 2, because I lost all faith in the helper.  I think the helper is biased, maybe getting a kickback for recommending Machine 1 all the time.  Why did the helper never recommend Machine 2? That was a question I asked myself.
########
Forget that helper, that person is only out to help him or herself! He seemed to only be right once...
########
Machine 2 seemed to be paying out more per average than machine 1, so I ignored the helper and went back to Machine 2!
