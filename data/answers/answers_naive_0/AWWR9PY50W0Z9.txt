I knew nothing but was told my helper had some knowledge of the machines, so for first choice I went with their pick
########
still early and I was sticking with the helpers advice.
########
I was winning on the helpers advice so I kept it going.
########
I had gotten a low reward with the last spin and so thought I would give the second machine a try.
########
I got a really nice jackpot on the first try of the second machine, so I tried again.
########
Second machine after 2 picks was averaging much more than the recommended machine so I kept going with it.
########
Going with my own experience from past rounds.
########
I was still doing better, but I wanted to bring both machines to 4 picks to compare their average over the same number of picks.
########
Machine 2's average, that I just had to keep going with it.
########
Machine 2's average is still twice as much so I was just going to keep riding it out until it might get me.
