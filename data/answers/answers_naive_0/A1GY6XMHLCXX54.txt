There was no data to go from, so I just picked one.
########
I chose the machine that hadn't been used yet.
########
I got a better amount on the first machine, so I went back to it.
########
I got a low amount machine 2, so I tried machine 1 to see if I could do better.
########
The average on machine 1 was higher, so I used it again.
########
Machine 2 had a higher average, so I chose it instead.
########
I used machine 2 because the average was higher.
########
Machine 2 had a higher average. Also, I was a little annoyed that I could win 0.
########
The average was higher on machine 2. Plus, the "helper" only chose the machine I wasn't using.
########
I stuck with the machine that I thought would be best.
