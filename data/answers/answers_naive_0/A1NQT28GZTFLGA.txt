I wanted to test out machine 1 first to see winnings.
########
I was happy with the 56 cent earnings  in round 1 
so I decided to stick with the machine.
########
Again, the winnings seemed like a good amount to me so I stuck with the machine.
########
I was happy with the average earnings on this machine and felt good about continuing to play it.
########
Although i was satisfied with the average winning from machine 1, I wanted to try out machine 2 at least once to see if it might pay out even higher.
########
Because I only won 9 cents on machine 2, I went back to machine 1.
########
Decided to stick with machine 1 after poor winnings on machine 2.
########
The 43 cent average on machine 1 was a lot better than the 9 cents I won when I tried machine 2, so I stuck with number 1.

########
Machine 1 seems to be paying out less and less, so I went back and tried machine 2 again.
########
Winnings on machine 2 weren't impressive, so I went back to machine 1.
