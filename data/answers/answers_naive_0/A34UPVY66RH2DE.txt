I thought the helper would be reliable
########
I liked the reward I got so the helper seemed reliable
########
I liked the reward this time even more so I stayed with this one
########
I felt comfortable sticking with the helper's advice
########
I was afraid of things not going as well with the other machine
########
I felt loyalty to the helper
########
I am still pleased with the helper here
########
At this point I start thinking about choosing the other machine because of curiosity but I still trust the helper's advice
########
I am really happy with my reward from the helpers pick
########
I am still considering changing to the other machine but the helper's pick still is really good for me
