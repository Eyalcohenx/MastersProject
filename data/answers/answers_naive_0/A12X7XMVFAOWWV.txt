The previous round was pretty good so I decided to choose the same machine.

Since the previous 2 rounds were good, I stuck with the same machine.

Machine 2 was better than 1 in the last round, so I chose it again.
########
Machine 2 was much better in the past 2 rounds, so I chose it again.
########
Machine 2 wasn't as good this last time, but its average was still higher so I chose it.
########
Machine 2's average was still higher so I kept choosing it.
########
Machine 2's average was still higher.
