I wanted to see how it went trusting the helper.
########
The first time seemed fine so I used the helper again.
########
I wanted to try the other machine, just in case.
########
The second machine had given me a higher reward before so I used it again.
########
I started to doubt machine 2 so maybe the helper was right.
########
I didn't like the output before so I don't trust the helper anymore.
########
Machine number 2 seems to do well so I stick to it.
########
I don't trust the helper anymore at all.
########
I keep choosing 2 because it's working fine.
########
I like machine number 2 a lot better than 1 at this point.
