i just felt in my gut that left would be the best option to test the waters.
########
Since the payout seemed fairly low, I alternated to see what the other machine would offer.
########
The machine was comically low, and I figured it was just bad luck. So I tried the machine #2 again.
########
The payouts were trending up on average, so I stuck with what was working.
########
The last payout was the highest i seen, so I still stayed the course.
########
It got low again, but I stayed optimistic that it was just trying to get me to switch over.
########
I swapped to machine #1 again to see what it would give me. The reward was low like I expected.
########
Since machine #1 was still low, I stuck with #2 for the remainder of the task.
########
The payout could've been worse, so I stayed with machine #2.
########
And the payout was back to being high. Just like I thought it would.
