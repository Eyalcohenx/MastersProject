I figured for the first round I would take the helper's recommendation no matter what.
########
I wanted another helper's recommendation to kind of get a gauge
########
Again I wanted to kind of come up with an average of the helper
########
Now I just wanted to see what going against the helper would bring
########
I wanted to get a better idea of going against the helper would get me
########
Average was about the same so i just took the helper
########
again average was about the same so i just took the helper
########
got kind of bored taking the helper
########
Average of taking helper was better
########
Average of helper was better
