I went with my gut instinct
########
The machine paid good on the previous round
########
It was still paying pretty good so why not
########
I was feeling lucky
########
I Found that every other turn pick the other machine
########
It seemed if i chose the same machine 2 times in a row i would get a low prize. So choose machine 1 and then choose machine 2
########
I kept going back in forth between the machines
########
Machine 1 has been paying low on the second time in a row if its chosen
########
It was time to switch back to machine 1 on this one
########
Switching back and forth between the machines seemed to be working
