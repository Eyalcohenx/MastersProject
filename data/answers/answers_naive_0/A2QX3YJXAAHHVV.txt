I decided to begin by taking the helpers advice and see how it worked. I figured we would try it to begin. 
########
I figured I would give the helper 5 trys
########
I continued with my plan of giving it 5 tries.
########
I was sticking with my idea of giving each machine 5 or six tries.
########
I finished out my plan. I figured it would be time to swap. 
########
I decided to give the other machine a go, to test its results. 
########
I continued with my plan of using the second machine, testing the average results. 
########
I wasn't getting any machine change advice from the helper, and continued the plan of trying the other machine for a few goes. 
########
I was beginning to suspect the helper was biased, and continued testing for my own research. 
########
I wanted to give each machine a fair amount of trials, and finished my plan.
