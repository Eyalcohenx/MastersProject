Since I hadn't tried any machine yet I figured I would test out the recommended one.
########
Since I won a decent prize last time, I went with the recommendation again.
########
I got very curious about how well the other machine would pay out.
########
I tested to see if the recommended machine would ever give me a high payout because maybe last time was a fluke.
########
Since that was a low payout I went with my high-paying machine.
########
Still wanted high payouts even if it wasn't recommended.
########
Taking more high payouts instead of taking advice that seemed misleading.
########
I got a really low payment from my preferred machine so I took the advice and used the recommended one.
########
Still no big jackpots on the recommended one so I decide to try my luck with the second machine.
########
Still trying to get more really big payouts.
