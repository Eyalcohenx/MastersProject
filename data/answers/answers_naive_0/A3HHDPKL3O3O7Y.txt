I didn't trust that the helper was telling me what would be best for myself rather than his/herself.
########
I wanted to try the other machine, thinking the helper may be acting in their interest and not mine.
########
I went with the machine that just gave me a good payout.
########
I decided to stick with the machine that was giving a good payout.
########
I began to suspect the helper was lying to me and that I should choose the other machine often.
########
I still thought the helper was acting in their interest and that I should stick with the machine with a good history of paying me.
########
I believed this machine had better payouts.
########
I wanted to check the other machine to see if possibly it was better.
########
I again wanted to vary my choices and see if machine 1 was giving out better rewards now.
########
Just varying my choices in case one was not drastically better than the other.
