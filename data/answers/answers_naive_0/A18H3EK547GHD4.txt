No machine had been picked yet, and I wanted to test the one not suggested by the helper.
########
I won first round with the machine not suggested by the helper, so i wanted to try the one suggested by the helper, now. The reward was smaller.
########
I wanted to confirm if the machine suggested by the helper had lower rewards.
########
Still checking on the average reward of the machine suggested by the helper. It's smaller than the other machine.
########
Wanted to try if the machine not suggested by the helper still gave out higher rewards (it didn't, this time)
########
Still wanted to see if this machine would give higher rewards.
########
I wanted to follow the helper's advice, this time.
########
I just wanted to try sheer luck, disregarding the helper suggestion. 
########
I liked this machine better, i realize.
########
I decided this machine would be my "lucky one" - and the reward was big.
