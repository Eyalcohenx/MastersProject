Went with the highest probability of a win at the computers suggestion
########
Stayed with the computer choice. 
########
The helper had on twice in a row, ent with the unknown.
########
Back to the computer...thinking it may hit since i passed on it last time
########
Again, tried the unknown since the helper hit again.
########
Both machines were close to even on overall payout. Went back to the computer helper.
########
At this point I was just going back and forth. No logic at all.
########
Again, just going back and forth.
########
Figured my luck was running low, stayed with the helper.
########
Yeah... I think I had a decent hit on the helper so I went back to the other.
