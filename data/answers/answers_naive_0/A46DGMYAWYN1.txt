In round one, I was keeping in mind that the helper had something to gain by me selecting a certain machine, so I specifically went with the machine they didn't recommend. 
########
Winning the 50 cents off of the machine that wasn't recommended was really good (in my opinion) and I wanted to see if my luck would repeat if I went with the other machine again. 
########
I wanted to pick the machine opposite the helpers advice so that I would have SOME data to compare. I was looking for patterns, specifically. 
########
I wanted to take a chance and abandon what I thought the "pattern" was to try to gain the biggest reward in this round. I decided to abandon login and give into chance. 
########
I remember specifically for this round, I was focusing on the info underneath each machine that showed how many cents on average were being won. I went with machine 2, since this number was larger. 
########
I was pleased with the amount I won in the last round on machine 2 and with the average won on the machine. I decided to continue heading in this direction. 
########
I felt like I was on a "lucky streak" with machine #2 and still enjoying that the average was higher at 48 cents than Machine 1 at 31 cents. 
########
In my mind at this point in the game, I'm thinking Machine 2 is the absolute best choice to go with and that Machine 1 is definitely what is benefitting the helper. 
########
This move was a pure attempt to not take the helpers advice. 
########
At this point, I was hoping that I could raise the average cashout on machine 1 so that it could be closer to Machine 2. I'm starting to think at this point that they might be capable of an equal payout based on how many clicks I invest.
