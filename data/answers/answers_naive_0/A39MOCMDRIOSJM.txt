The game was just starting. I felt it was too risky to stray from the safer pick by the helper.
########
I did fine on the first pick, but here, I wanted to see if there were big gains to be had from not using the helper's advice.
########
I liked what happened with machine two before, so I wanted to go against the helper and pick it again.
########
Machine 2 seemed to be lagging a bit. I ignored the helper, hoping machine 2 stepped things up in terms of luck.
########
I just felt that machine 2 was due for a big payout. It was a hunch, so I ignored the helper.
########
Machine 2 had been paying out better. I did not want to press my luck. I felt the helper's choice was safer, so I went with that.
########
It seemed to me like machine 1 was doing too well. I felt machine 2 would be safer, so I decided to ignore the helper and pick that.
########
Machine 1 seemed better on average than machine 2. I decided to trust the helper, and hoped this average would continue to play out.
########
Both machines had a similar average I felt. I ignored the helper, hoping a risk on the slightly riskier machine 2 would pay big.
########
Both machines felt similar, but I seemed to remember machine 2 having bigger high payouts a few times. I ignored the helper, seeking a huge payoff from machine 2.
