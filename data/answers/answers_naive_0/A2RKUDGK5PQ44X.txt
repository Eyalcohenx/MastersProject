If i remember well at the first rounf helper's advise was to pick machine 1, not 2. Anyway was a random decision, without any reason. 
########
I choose first machine because i got a good reward after first round. 
########
I chose the second machine because i wanted to know what rewards are offered. 
########
The second machine was chosen because offered a good reward. 
########
I really think that i followed the advice sometimes. Again, changed the machine randomly. 
########
Changed the machine because i did not receive a good bonus. 
########
This time I am sure i chose the helper's advise. Anyway i choose number 1 because i wanted to change. 
########
I chose number one because i hoped for a bigger reward. I was mistaken. 
########
Changed again after seeing that machine 1 does not give bigger rewards. 
########
Picked again because the average reward for second machine is bigger than for first one.
