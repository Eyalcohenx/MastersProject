I I got a good bonus on machine number 2 the first time. Wanted to stick to that machine.
########
I got a high bonus on machine 1 last time, wanted to see if I could get another one

I was getting good bonuses

I was trying to see if after so many times on one machine if switching would give me more, but it didnt
########
seems like when I switched machines my bonus was low
########
I was upset at this pick. Something told me to stay with machine 2 but I did not listen
########
decided to go back to the machine I was staying with
########
decided to stay with the machine i had a good feeling with
########
I felt like when I first did the helpers advice, it really did not help me. I stayed with machne 2
