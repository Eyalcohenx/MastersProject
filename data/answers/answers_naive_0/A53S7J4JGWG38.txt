It was my first try, so was a bit more random. Wanted to see if the helper would be good.
########
I was somewhat happy with that result, so went again.
########
The other machine was going down, was time to try the first machine.
########
My best reward yet, so went again with this machine and took helper's advice.
########
46 cents also a decent result, so went again with it.
########
Reward going down, time to switch and not listen to helper.
########
Started to realize Machine 2 was better, especially as I could see averages now.
########
Felt like being a bit more random in case Machine 2 was starting to give lesser rewards.
########
Went back to the initial thought. Machine 2 is better.
########
Sticking with Machine 2.
