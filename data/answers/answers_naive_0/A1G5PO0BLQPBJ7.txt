I chose number two just as a whim to see what the initial award was going to look like. I then proceeded and planned on only using machine one per recommendation of the helper.
########
I wanted to just stick with machine one at this point because I wanted to see the variables on one machine to see the consistency. I was writing down numbers only from machine one to see if I could notice a trend. 
########
Continuing with the plan, I chose only machine one. After seeing a half prize drop I almost wanted to switch to machine 2, but I wanted to stay consistent. 
########
The number stayed the same roughly for prize so I kept with the plan to stay with machine one. 
########
The drop in prize was continuing and an urge in me made me almost want to switch, but it wasn't bad enough that I wanted to switch next round. 
########
13 cents was the reward and I was thinking maybe I should switch here because the odds are not playing in my favor. However, with a thought that this might be rigged in some way I thought that my next play was going to award much higher. 
########
I received 5 cents for this round. It took a lot of thinking on whether or not to switch here. I was initially thinking with survey bias that this is definitely rigged and that there is no way I would receive any lower in prize than this. My intention was that I will switch if my next prize is lower than 30 cents the following round. 
########
I received and a whopping 93 cents for this round. At this point, I was getting quite curious as to what's happening with the machines. The nearly 1 dollar jump really made me think there is a rigged aspect in this random machine. I had a strong inkling that my next reward was going to be significantly lower than the 93 cents and will continue trending in a similar fashion as it did when I received the 70 something cents initially from this machine. 
########
I think I have my rounds mixed up. Last round I think wrote that I received the 33 cents when in fact it was this round. But in the manner that I had expected, the prize was much lower than the 93 cents. The next round I was expecting another drop as it did in the first use of this machine. 
########
The trend continued and I was continuing to expect that it would keep dropping, but then the game ends.
