When playing i saw that i won more and higher amounts on machine 2 which I would continue to play until I see a change in the winning streak 
########
I play a machine if I win I would continue to play until I lose
########
Checking to see if machine would pay better
########
Machine one did not pay better so i went back to two
########
Staying with the winner
########
Tried again to see if the odds change it did not
########
One more try to see if it would change
########
Last try to see if I would win 
########
Went back to the winning machine
########
Just staying with a winner
