Because I wanted to see how it all worked
########
I won a decent amount so thought Id do the same
########
Wanted to see what machine 2 had different
########
After winning big I thought Id go back to machine 1
########
Because I felt the helper knew best
########
I believe I got a really low amount and wanted to see if the other machine would win more
########
Because I still felt like I needed to trust the helper
########
Continued to trust the helper
########
continued to trust the helper 
########
because I felt like he wouldnt lie to me
