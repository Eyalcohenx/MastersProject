I was just making a random choice
########
I was testing the machine's payout
########
I was satisfied with the machine's payout so far
########
I thought the machine was doing well
########
I was winning what looked like good jackpots
########
I was satisfied
########
I wanted to keep with the machine because it was consistent
########
I thought I should see what the other machine would do
########
Machine 2 was giving more for jackpots
########
I liked the payout of machine 2
