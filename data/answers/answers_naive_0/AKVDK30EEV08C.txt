I thought I'd start there to see if they were really helpful.
########
They were helpful so I decided to try their help again.
########
They were still being helpful.
########
I was tempted to try machine 2 but thought I might do worse so stuck with their help.
########
After they didn't seem to help I decided to try the opposite one.
########
I did better without their help so I thought I'd keep trying the opposite.
########
The rewards were still better.
########
The rewards were pretty good with what I was doing.
########
I was concerned about using the helper's advice, that the awards would go down.
########
I was sticking with what was working.
