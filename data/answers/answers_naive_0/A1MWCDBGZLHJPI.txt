i started out thinking the helper was recommending a machine that might benefit them.
########
i was not sure if 20 cents was a good payout so i tried the other machine.
########
i was happier with the higher result so i decided to try again to see if this was the machine with higher payout odds.
########
i continued to be happy with machine number 2.
########
i still thought machine number 2 might have the better payout odds despite the round 4 result.
########
i continue to think machine number 2 might have the better payout odds.
########
i began to doubt my luck and the payout odds of machine 2 so i tried machine 1 again.
########
i was trying to see if i could get an idea of machine 1 odds so i tried it again.
########
i am not convinced machine 1 has good payout odds so i try machine 2 again.
########
i did not like the machine 2 result so decided if my odds on machine 1 are better.
