I had this suspicion I'd be better off without advice.
########
I made money on the first roll so I decided to stay with machine 2.
########
Again, I was collecting money so I continued with 2.
########
I think at this point I did not get any $$$. However, the track record had been good so I stayed with machine 2.
########
Still going with the winner, ignoring advice
########
STILL going with the machine as it was consistently paying
########
Same logic as previous. Although there was this nagging feeling the advice might have paid more I ignored it.
########
By now I was set on machine 2 as it was paying.
########
Still staying wit a proven winner
########
Machine 2 has been pretty good to me.
