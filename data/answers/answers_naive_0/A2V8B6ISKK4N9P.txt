its my first turn so i wanted to go with the first option
########
it have me 18 cents i felt its good so went with it again 
########
tried same machine again so i can learn more about its average
########
it was giving me like 18 or 20 cents so i keep preferring the number 1
########
i like the cents the same machine was giving .
########
keep testing the number 1 machine i did not want to try out the other machine yet.
########
the cents increased so i kept preferring the same machine not to risk my choice
########
did not want to risk the picking so chose number 1 again and fixed to open only number 1 until last turn as i felt the average was good too.
########
the average was good so i did not change the pick
########
average was not bad so i chose it again and again.
