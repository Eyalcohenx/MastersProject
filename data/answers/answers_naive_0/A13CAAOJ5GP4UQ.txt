I thought they knew what my best odds were of winning
########
I won money from the first round so I trusted the helper
########
I wanted to win more money and I thought the helper's recommendation was reasonable
########
This machine hadn't let me down. I didn't want to chance it on another machine
########
Since I was still winning money, I felt this was the right machine to pick
########
I didn't want to change at this point. I was used to this machine
########
I felt like the machine was fine and the helper was doing an ok job
########
I didn't want to change machines at this point, even though I questioned if I needed to
########
I wanted to stay with the machine I was at least winning something. I was afraid machine two had less winnings
########
I decided to stay with the machine that was winning. I was afraid I'd win less with the other machine
