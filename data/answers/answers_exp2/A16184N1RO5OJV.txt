I just want to know if the helper helps me or just want to benefit him/herself. I just want to know what is the reward for the helper's recommendation. 
########
I think the helper's advice is quite good but I need more information from the recommendation to see if it gives a good reward so I decided to try again. 
########
I want to know the reward from the other machine. 
########
I need to know more about the reward from the other machine before deciding to go with the helper or not. 
########
I think the other machine gives a better reward. 
########
I think that machine gives a better reward than the other one based on the statistic. 
########
Machine 1 gives a good amount of reward and is better on average. Maybe I should stick with it for a while. 
########
The previous reward is not so great so maybe I should change to the other machine. Maybe machine 1 is out of "luck".
########
Maybe I should try Machine 1 again because probably the good reward is back. Overall it still have better reward statistically. 
########
I don't think the helper's advice helps at all so probably I just try the other machine (not the one the helper recommended).
