My strategy was to pick the one the helper recommended. 
########
I continued with my strategy of picking the one the helper picked.
########
I thought I would try to see if maybe the one the helper didn't recommend would have a good pay off. 
########
I went back to my strategy of following the helpers advice.
########
Here, I just took a chance on the one that wasn't recommended 
########
I liked the results of the previous round so for this round I stuck with the one the helper didn't recommend. 
########
I went back to listening to the helper because I couldn't find any particular pattern that would help me with choosing.
########
I stayed with my idea of listening to the helper because I couldn't figure out a pattern on my own.
########
I stayed with the helper's advice because I couldn't figure out any pattern.
########
Again, I chose to use helper's advice because I couldn't discover any type of pattern.
