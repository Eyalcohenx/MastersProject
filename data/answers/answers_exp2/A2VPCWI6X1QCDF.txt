It was the start of the game, and I thought I would use their advice to see what happened.
########
I was happy with the first outcome, so went with their choice again.
########
I was willing to take their advice, because it hadn't steered me wrong yet.
########
The average for that machine was already higher, so went with their suggestion.
########
The outcome averages were close, so decided to stick with their choice for luck.
########
Figured that I wouldn't continue with the high numbers on the other machine, so went with their suggestion.
########
Numbers average were high, they suggested it, so why not.
########
The other machine had paid a lot already, and they suggested the one I picked so I went with it...They had been helpful so far.
########
Machine was paying good, and it was suggested so why not.
########
I went with them because it is a game of luck, and why not humor the suggestions?
