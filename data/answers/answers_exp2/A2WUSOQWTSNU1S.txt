Just felt going with the helper to start was the better choice.
########
Stayed with the winning machine.
########
Helper choice did not contribute to my decision. Stayed with the winning machine.
########
Again, stayed with the winning machine.
########
Average win wasn't great on machine number 2 so decided to make a change.
########
Stayed with the winning machine. Helper's advice did not affect my decision.
########
Overall average best on machine 1 so stayed with that choice.
########
Machine one average continued to be best so stayed with that one.
########
As before, overall average on machine one was best so stayed with that.
########
Stayed with the machine with the best overall average win. I did not adopt helper's advice over my own decision expect for the very first round.
