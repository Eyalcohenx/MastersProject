I decided to trust the helper on the first pick as I had no clue which was the best machine and I had to pick one
########
I had chosen number 1 on the first round, I needed to choose number 2 on the second to see what it gave me to learn which was best this coincided with the helpers choice
########
I chose number 2 in this case because it gave me the best result, and it coincided with the helpers choice
########
I went with the machine that gave the best result
########
I went with the helper because i got a poor result on the previous choice
########
I went with number 2 because it had the higher average
########
I went with number 2 again because of the higher average
########
number 2 had the higher average result
########
I stuck with number 2 because of the higher average 
########
Number 2 had given me a good result on the previous round
