I had to pick one, and had no information, so I went with the helper's choice. 
########
I thought I got a high reward, so I chose the machine again. 
########
I went with the machine that I was doing well with. 
########
Again, I kept using the machine that I was doing well with. 
########
I had two 10 cent wins, so I decided to change machines. 
########
I won 94 cents, I think. I thought, well, maybe this is the better machine then, so I stayed with the machine. 
########
I started looking at the average cents won at this point. 
########
Made my decision based on the average amount in picks so far. 
########
Again, stayed with the average cents per pick. 
########
The last few spins on machine 1 weren't great, and the average of the other machine was now better, so I picked it.
