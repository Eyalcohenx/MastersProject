I wanted to see how good the advice would be
########
It didn't work out so well the first time so I did the opposite
########
I just didn't trust the advice
########
Machine 2 seemed to be paying out more regardless of the advice
########
I was making more money from machine 2
########
Not that I can really tell from your "replay mode" but I think the other machine didn't pay out very well last round so I decided to change it up.
########
I guess it paid out relatively well last time.  Instead of having someone try to remember choices and reasons after multiple rounds maybe it would be better to do this as people are actually making these choices.
########
The other machine paid out better
########
The other machine was consistently paying better
########
I didn't trust the advice
