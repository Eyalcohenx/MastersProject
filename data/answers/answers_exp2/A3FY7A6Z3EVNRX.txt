I figured since it was one or the other I would go with the helper's recommendation
########
It worked the first time so I went with the recommendation again.
########
It seems to be working ok, so I went along again.  
########
Again, it seems to be working in my favor, so I continued
########
I figured I would see what the prize was on the machine not recommended.  
########
The non-recommended pick did not seem to yield higher results, so I went back.  
########
Helper's advice seems to be best
########
I was just getting bored with the experiment.  Bonus does not seem to be high
########
at this point just trying to accumulate points.
########
Just trying to figure out if there is actual money to be won playing this game.
