I chose what the helper said because i had no reason to choose otherwise
########
I again chose the helpers choice because i hadnt chosen this machine yet and had no reason to not choose it.
########
I had a higher yield with this machine as well as the helpers advice.
########
Once again i had gotten a higher yield from this machine and it was the helpers choice.
########
I assumes that this machine was the higher yielding one and was choosing it based on that and the helper.
########
I felt that I needed more evidence in knowing that machine had  alower payout.
########
Machine one again proved to be the lower payout so i went back to choosing machine two with the helper.
########
I felt that machine two would give me a higher payout based on my earlier choices
########
I wanted to choose machine two people i believed it had a higher average payout.
########
I once again chose machine two based on the average payout and helper choice.
