I figured I would go with the helper on my first choice
########
Again I was trying to maximize my rewards by going with the helper pick.
########
After not winning a lot from the helper, I figured I would gamble for something bigger.
########
I was looking at my picks and I went with my gut fealing.
########
This time I went with the helper's advice to get the most rewards.
########
I feel like the helper chose the higher reward so I went with their pick. 
########
I was looking at the average of the winning and went with the higher average.
########
Again I went for the helpers advice because they knew the statistics
########
I should have listed to the helper but I wanted to win huge.
########
I wanted to go back to the helper because every time I chose a machine It was less than what the helper chose.
