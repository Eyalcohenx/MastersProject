Did not know how the system would work and wanted to see if helper would keep picking same machine (even if I didn't pick what they chose.)
########
Wanted to see if helper changed machines based on my pick (and not knowing average per machine I didn't care which I chose)
########
Same as first picked.  Wanted to see what helper would do plus wanted to see payout of other machine.
########
Still wanted to see if helper would switch machines plus machine 2 had higher payout the first time.
########
Machine had average higher payout so wanted to keep with that machine.
########
Wanted to see if average could be raised on other machine or if I should just stick with Machine 2.
########
higher aveage.  stuck with that machoine
########
Since helper kept switching machines, I figured it was somewhat random and wanted to see if average would go up in machine 1.
########
Good payout in prior pick so wanted to see if average could keep going up.
########
Average of machine one kept going up.  Regardless of helpers advice, I went with Machine 1.
