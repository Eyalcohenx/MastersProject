I wanted to see if the advice of the helper would be beneficial to me and not just the helper
########
Wanted to see if changing machines would be to my benefit
########
Tried to determine if the helper's advice was to my benefit so went against the advice for a turm
########
Testing if helper's advice was to my benefit
########
Thinking the right machine might always have a higher payout
########
Went with the right machine as a higher potential payout
########
Still thinking right machine had a higher payout every time
########
Hoping the helper's advice would be to my benefit
########
Back to thinking the right machine always had a higher payout
########
Hoping the helper's advice would be to my maximum benefit
