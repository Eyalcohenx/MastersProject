I wanted to go with the recomendation first
########
I won a good amount so I went with it again
########
I was going to switch over on the 3rd try anyway. So I was happy to see it wasthe recomendation
########
I wanted to see what would happen if I went against the helpers choice this time
########
I noticed the average was higher on slot 2
########
Stayed with 2 because average was higher
########
Average was still higher
########
wanted to see if the average would increase
########
average didnt increase for slot 1 so I went back to 2
########
higher average on slot 2
