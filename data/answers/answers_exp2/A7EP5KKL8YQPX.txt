I decided to follow helper's advice since it would be an equal guess for the first try
########
The helper has a better idea of which machine produces more money in this game
########
I wanted to see what would happen if I did not follow the helper's advice
########
I feel like the amount i got from not listening to the helper was significantly less so I decided to go back to listening to the helper's advice
########
I won a decent amount on the last pick listening to the helper so i repeated this
########
I was on a roll with the helper's advice so I kept it going
########
I thought the helper was my buddy and I could trust the helper at this point in the game
########
i got curious again what would happen if I did not listen to the helper later in the game
########
The turn before not listening to the helper's advice I did not do very well so I went back to listening to the helper
########
The helper was making me good money so I decided to follow them again
