I was testing and decided to follow the helper's suggestion to see what kind of outcome would happen. 
########
I was satisfied with the helper's outcome the first round and stuck with it's suggestion. 
########
I continued with the helper's suggestion because of the high outcomes that came before.

########
I still had faith in the helper's outcome prediction. 
########
I was still satisfied with the helper's outcomes. 
########
At this point I was beginning to wonder about the helper's accuracy but still had faith in it's outcomes. 
########
I questioned whether the helper's outcome would be low next round but still stood with it's decision. 
########
I was disappointed in some of the outcomes the helper made before so I decided to see what the outcome would be for a non helper decision. 
########
I went back to the helper's recommendation because I believed the helper would only be incorrect about an outcome one out of every three times. 
########
I believed that the helper would only be wrong about an outcome the last round so I stuck with it's recommendation.
