I had faith in the choice of the helper and chose to follow their advice.
########
I really wanted to see if there would be any tricks. I didn't know whether the helper's advice would be honest or not.
########
After getting a lower amount in the round previously. I wanted to try the helper's advice again to see if the results would be any better.
########
I chose to follow the helper's advice to see if there would be any trickery or deception.
########
The helper's advice had been pretty consistent up to this point, so I chose to follow their advice.
########
I wondered again if there was any deception going on, so I chose to not follow the helper and their advice.
########
I have a hard time trusting, and did not believe the helper was giving me the best advice.
########
After the previously round, I felt that maybe the helper was trying to give me their best advice.
########
I really did not know if the helper was being deceptive, so I chose to take my chance by not adopting the helper's advice.
########
After the previous round, I felt like giving the helper a chance to redeem their self.
