I wanted to help the helper.
########
The helper was doing me good so far
########
The helper recommended it and the odds seemed better.
########
I was going along with the helper
########
The helper's advice was sound up to this point.
########
The helper had done me good so far.
########
The winnings were higher and the helper's advice so far had been stout.
########
Better winnings and the helper seemed to have a knack for picking the winner
########
The machine was hot. The helper was on to something!
########
I thought I would take a chance on the machine that was paying best, and to see if not adopting the helper's advice would have any consequences.
