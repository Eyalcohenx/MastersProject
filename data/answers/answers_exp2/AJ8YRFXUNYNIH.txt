I wanted to try the unproven machine first.
########
I wanted to go against the advice and make the decision on my own.
########
I thought I would try the advice based on a feeling and it worked out.
########
At this point I randomly picked the machine.
########
I wanted to go with the higher average.
########
I thought machine ! might be due for a bigger payoff.
########
I wanted to stay with a higher payoff.
########
Machine 2 was becoming my favorite.
########
I took the recommendation because I wanted more money.
########
I was counting on machine 2 to payoff big.
