Machine 2 had the higher probability to win a better prize
########
Because i trust in helper's advice, first round was very good
########
Second round was not very well, but i still trust
########
Machine 2 in previous round was the better option
########
Because past experience says to me, machine 2 is better
########
Machine 2 have better prizes, and it was the helpers advice
########
Even prize are now lower i still prefer machine 2
########
i still trust in machine two, better prizes
########
I changed because prizes in machine 2 are now lower
########
Well perhaps helper advice is good, i gave it an opportunity
