Since they both had not been picked yet, I just made the choice not to adopt the helper's advice, no other reason in this case.
########
Once again I decided to not adopt the advice, only because machine 1 was not picked yet, just to see the amount.
########
This round I decided to take the helper's advice, I figured I would try the machine twice in a row.
########
I decided to go against the helper, just to take a chance and see if it paid off, I figured I had a good shot changing things up.
########
On this one I thought to myself that machine 2 would have the higher of the two payouts, I ignored the helper for that very reason.
########
I felt I should "let it ride" in a sense and select the same machine, as well the helper picked it. 
########
I thought 1 would have a higher payout, it was just a feeling I had, even ignoring the helper.
########
I felt it time to switch things up again, ignoring the helper and thinking 2 would be the smart choice.
########
Once again after thinking a few seconds I thought going with number 2 again would give a higher payout, ignoring the helper completely.
########
I liked the results of number 2 and decided to take the risk as well the helper selected it.
