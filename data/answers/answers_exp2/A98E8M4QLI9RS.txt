I didn't have anything to base my decision on except using the helper's advice so that is what I chose for the first round.
########
Since the first machine I chose had a very low result, I chose the 2nd machine and it was the one the helper advised so I took a chance.
########
My results were so good with this machine the first time, I wanted to see what would happen if I picked it again.
########
Still good results with this machine and was hoping that my luck would continue. I was also worried that if I picked the other machine, I would get very low results again.
########
I wanted to continue with machine number 2 because I felt I was getting good results with the amount I was winning for it. It seemed less risky. At this point, I wasn't counting on the helper to give me good advice.
########
I was averaging 72 cents per pick which I thought was a good result and thought it was probably the best decision to continue picking this machine.
########
I didn't trust the helper to give me the best advice and stuck with machine 2 because I was most likely to get a good pay off.
########
I was still getting a good pay off and wanted to continue on without taking the risk of pick the first machine.
########
I was curious to see what would happen if I chose the first machine and wanted to see if I could trust the helper so I picked one 
########
I knew that my average was higher with machine 2 so I went back to picking that to increase my earnings before I lucked out on the dice roll.
