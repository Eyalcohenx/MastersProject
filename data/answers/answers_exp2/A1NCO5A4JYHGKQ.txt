As no picks yet, I went with the recommendation as nothing else to base pick on. 
########
I was going to pick the one that hadn't been picked yet, either way.
########
Now I want to see if I can figure out the recommendations. I am going to stay with it for a bit. 
########
I am doing ok with the recommendations so sticking with it unless it gets too lopsided. 
########
So far so good with recommendations. I can't figure out which one helper is prone to yet so staying with it. Avg is good as well. 
########
Helper going back and forth it seems. I can't figure out which one is better so I'll stay with help.
########
Avg on this one is better. I was going with it regardless of helper. 
########
Wanted to see what happens if I go against helper. Nothing to lose really. 
########
Back to the helper since last one didn't work so well. The averages are getting lower. 
########
Again, staying with helper. Not doing as well as start.
