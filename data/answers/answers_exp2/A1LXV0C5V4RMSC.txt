There wasn't any data I could see so far so I decided to go with the helper.
########
It made sense to try this machine so that I could see the odds for it and try to determine if the helper was telling the truth or choosing for their own benefit.
########
The machine I chose had just done a high payout so I thought to test my luck with it. 
########
I went with the helper's advice because then I would have more data to compare the machines myself. Two picks a piece would give a better average.
########
The machine the helper chose had clearly lower payout based on my personal experience so I went with my gut and chose the other machine instead.
########
Again, the machine I chose was paying out much more than I had experienced from the helper's recommended machine.
########
If I remember correctly, the payout last time had dipped a little on machine 2, so I decided to give machine one another go. I was curious as to what finally made the helper pick machine 2.
########
Machine 1 didn't pay out the best, so I went with the helper's advice, especially since it matched my personal experience.
########
Again, machine 2 seemed to be paying out more so I chose to stick with it.
########
The last couple of times the helper's choices proved reliable so I chose to go with it again.
