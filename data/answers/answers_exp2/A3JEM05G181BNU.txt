The helper is biased, so I have ignored her recommendation for now. I started with Machine 1 just for simplicity.
########
I was happy with the payout from Machine 1, but I needed to see what the payout would be from Machine 2.
########
Machine 2 appeared from a very small sample to have a better payout.
########
Having accumulated a small pot, and recognizing that the game will terminate on double-6, I went back to Machine 1 to test it again. I note that the payouts are roughly of the same magnitude (it isn't 6 dollars vs 1 dollar, but a fews 10s of cents vs a few 10s of cents).
########
Machine 2 still seems best.
########
I think I am now sticking with Machine 2 and no special reason to revert to Machine 1.
########
Same rule as last round, expecting the game to terminate around round 18, but hoping to build the pot.
########
I think this was a 'punt' on the helper's advice, even though I don't trust them!
########
Machine 1 jackpot certainly did not persuade me to switch horses for the rest of the game.
########
ratio is about 3:2 for the payout, Machine 2 still the winner
