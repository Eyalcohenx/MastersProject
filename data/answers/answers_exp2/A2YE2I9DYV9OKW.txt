With no information to go on it seemed like an arbitrary choice, so I followed the helper's advice.

I wanted to gain information about the other machine, and the helper also recommended the second machine, so I decided to try it.
########
The reward from the previous around from machine 2 seemed to be pretty high, so I wanted to see if I could get another high reward from machine 2.
########
I was leaning toward believing machine 2 was the high-payout machine, but I only had limited information about machine 1 so I wanted to give it another try.
########
Having gotten another low to medium reward from machine 1, my belief that machine 2 was the better machine was strengthened. While not totally conclusive it seemed like picking machine 2 would lead to better rewards on average.
########
The results I got seemed consistent with the idea that machine 2 was the better choice, so I kept picking it.
########
I wanted good results, my working theory was that machine 2 was the better machine, so I picked it.
