There was nothing to influence either way so I chose to take helpers advice.
########
I won on first spin and figured that I would keep following for at least a little.
########
I had planned on switching machines regardless of whether or not helper chose this machine.
########
The machine did OK on the first shot so I thought I would give it a try again especially since the helper also recommended.
########
Higher per pick average and helper's choice is why I chose machine 2.
########
Following helper's advice and wanted to give machine 1 another chance.
########
Machine 2 was performing better and helper chose this one.
########
Machine 2 is having a higher rate of win than machine 1.
########
 I thought did not want to wear out my luck on machine 2 so I thought I would see what machine 1 was doing and helper did recommend.
########
Machine 2 is still outperforming machine 1.
