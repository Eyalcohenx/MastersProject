I started out following the helper's advice because I wanted to see how trustworthy the helper was.
########
To evaluate the payoff's between both machines and decide based on the average payoff's between the two I needed to test the second machine.
########
The helper was recommending a good payoff up to this point so I trusted them to be honest
########
up to this point I was trustful of the advice the helper was giving
########
I was still trustful of the advice being given
########
I believed the helper was giving me good advice so far
########
I tried to test what the other machine may payoff compared to the advice based on the average payoffs that were made so far
########
I decided to trust the helper
########
The helper chose the machine that had the higher average of payoffs so I was being trustful that it would be correct
########
I decided to choose on my own and pick the one that had a higher average payoff
