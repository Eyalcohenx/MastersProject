I depended on the helper to advise me.
########
After having one the first round, I was starting to trust the helper.
########
I was a little hesitant, but the helper hadn't misled me yet.
########
The helper at this point was becoming a trusted adviser.
########
Even if the helper was trying to mislead me, I felt it fair that they also get a bonus.
########
I was pretty sure this was the winningest machine.
########
I don't know why I wouldn't pick the best machine.
########
But, I realize the helper also needs to get paid.
########
Turns out, this might be the better machine after all.

########
Of course, I would pick the best machine.
