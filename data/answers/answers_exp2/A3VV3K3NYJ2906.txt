all things were equal at that stage and I could think of no reason not to follow the helpers advice
########
not having a good baseline for what the other machine might pay, i followed the helpers advice
########
i still did not have a clear indication of the baseline reward so i followed the helpers advice once again
########
a tricky decision but i opted to select what appeared to be the lower paying machine at this juncture and trust the helper
########
it was time to switch machines at this point to establish a better payment average. i would have selected this machine had the helper not suggested it as well
########
one more attempt at building an average is why i selected this machine
########
as before, i would have chosen this machine anyway to get parity of the number of spins. the helpers advice did not influence my choice
########
i began to suspect the helper was not actually being helpful and wanted to see what would happen in this case
########
the average was close to parity so i went with the helper
########
i wanted to average out the spins on each machine before my play time ended
