I had no additional information so the helper's choice was as good as my random choice.
########
I was willing to follow the helper's recommendation in order to see if the machine I didn't pick the previous round pays better
########
the helper's recommendations had earned me decent returns so I was willing to stay with the helper
########
machine 2 was paying out higher rewards so I decided to stay with machine 2 until the rewards decreased
########
again I was planning to stay with machine 2 until the machine stopped paying out high rewards
########
as with the previous round, I was sticking with machine 2 until the reward started to decrease
########
as with round 6 I was staying with machine 2 until the payout decreased
########
in round 7 machine 2 did not pay out any reward so I decided to switch machines, which coincided with the helper's recommendation
########
I decided to stay with machine 1 until the machine's payout started to decrease this decision just coincided with the helper's recommendation
########
the machine 1 payout decreased so I switched to machine 2
