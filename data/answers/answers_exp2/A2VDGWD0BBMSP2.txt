It was the first round so by default chose the helpers advice as I don't know much about the game yet.
########
I got a good payout in round 1 so chose to follow the helper's advice.
########
I wanted to see if I could trust the helper's advice again since the last round had such a low payout.
########
I wanted to see if the other machine had better payouts as the helpers advice didn't seem to be for my benefit.
########
I wanted to continue with the other machines payout regardless of helper's advice to see the average payout.
########
Was still testing the other machine to see the average payout.
########
I switched machines to the one with the highest average payout.
########
The payouts seem about the same so just picked at random.
########
I chose the machine giving me better payouts currently.
########
Due to a poor payout in the previous round I switched machines.
