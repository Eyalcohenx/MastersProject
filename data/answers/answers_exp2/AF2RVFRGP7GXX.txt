I thought maybe because the other one had more attention on it that it was intentional to try and draw my attention from the other one.
########
I though I would give this one a try to see if it would in fact pay more.
########
It paid well the last round so I tried again.
########
I thought it was trying to draw my attention away from machine 1.
########
I thought my luck may be running out on 1 so I tried 2 to see if it would pay more.
########
Machine 2 paid well so I went with it again.
########
I kept with machine two because it paid well the last couple rounds

########
I thought I would just try machine 1 again to see if it was paying more than machine 2.
########
I went back to what was paying well after the last round. It had nothing to do with the helpers advice.
########
I thought I was already doing good on machine two, so I kept to it.
