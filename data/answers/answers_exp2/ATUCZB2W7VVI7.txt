Since it was the first round, i picked the helper's choice
########
After winning in the first round, i decided to continue with the suggested choice
########
Since the winning average was above 50 virtual cents, i went again with the same machine
########
My winning average increased, so i thought why change to the other one, and went with machine 2
########
My winnings were increasing on average, so stuck with my machine 2
########
Again winnings were high on average, so stayed with machine 2
########
For this round, i decided not to take a risk and stay loyal to machine 2
########
This was another time were i decided to stick with my choice
########
Again i stuck with machine number 2
########
I ignored the helper's advice and stuck with the same machine
