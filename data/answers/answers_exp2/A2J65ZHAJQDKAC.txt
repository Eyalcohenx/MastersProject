I decided to see how well I would do with the helper's advice.
########
I liked the helper's advice on the last roll.
########
I wanted to see what would happen if I went against the helper.
########
I didn't fare well without the helper's advice so I decided to go with their decision.
########
I had been doing well with the helper.
########
I took a gamble to see what would happen.
########
I wanted to gamble and go against the helper again.
########
I thought it safer to go back to what the helper chose.
########
I did pretty well with the helper so far and thought it best to follow their advice.
########
I like to take a chance every once in a while and I took a chance.
