I didn't trust the helper.
########
Machine 2 worked for me so I tried it again.
########
It was going good with machine 2, so I did it again.
########
I still didn't trust the helper.
########
I tried the helper finally!
########
The helper was useful when I used it, so I did it again.
########
I chose it because it won 55 cents.  (vs. 36 cents)
########
I chose it because the helper advised it and it won more than the other machine.
########
I looked at the winnings and agreed with the helper.
########
I didn't trust the helper completely.
