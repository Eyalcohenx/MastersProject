I chose the one on the left because I didn't think the helper knew wjat they were doing.
########
I followed the helper's advice this time to see if I gained more than choosing on my own.
########
I hit big on this one, and I decided to alternate between the one the helper picks and the other one the helper didn't pick.
########
I alternated in my picks because of the amount gained, previously.
########
I thought the helper might be wrong.
########
I chose the helpers suggestion on this one because I seemed to find a pattern.
########
The pattern I thought I was seeing was incorrect and didn't amount to much on this round.
########
I didn't really have a structured plan of attack...I just picked one at random.
########
Really no rhyme or reason.I was just picking one or the other.
########
Just randomly choosing at this point.Maybe I had seen a pattern and was choosing the opposite of the last chosen machine from the previously chosen machine.
