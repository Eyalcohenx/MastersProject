The rules stated the helper knew which machine was better so i went with her
########
Same as before I chose to go with the helper hoping it was the better machine
########
The helper had been doing a good job so far so I continued with her
########
I continued to follow the helper's advice since I was winning
########
I continued to believe the helper knew the better machine to pick
########
This was where I still thought I should go with the helper but was starting to wonder if the other machine was the better payout
########
I was thinking maybe the other machine was better but I wanted to clarify my choices by going with the helper again
########
I still went with the helper but I think the other machine was the one paying out the highest at this point
########
I thought this machine was the higher paying out one and it was the one the helper chose so I went with it
########
I thought the other machine was the higher paying one so I didn't follow the advice
