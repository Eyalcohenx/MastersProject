This was the first one in the rounds so I picked the helper just to see what would happen with it.
########
I saw 89 cents and thought that looked like a winner as opposed to the other one.
########
I thought the helper was doing a good job and chose it again.
########
I chose to stay with the helper just to see what would happen with the money.
########
I wanted to see what would happen if I did not choose the helper.
########
I looked at the 42 cents and thought I could do better.
########
I saw 22 cents as opposed to 42 and went with the larger option.
########
Just took a chance that the award would be higher.
########
Again, wanted to see if I could earn a little more.
########
I chose the helper because so far it had done pretty well.
