I chose the machine that was suggested by the helper because I did not have a preference for the other machine.
########
I again chose the helpers machine because I wanted to see if the payout would be good.
########
I chose the helpers machine as I felt that so far the helper was giving me good advice.
########
The helper’s advice was working out well for me so I decided to continue with it.
########
Again the helper seemed to result in a good payout for me so I stayed with it.
########
My rewards by following the helper’s advice were paying off well so I continued with it.
########
I again chose the helper’s machine in order to maximize my reward.
########
At this point I felt my reward was getting pretty high and did not want to risk it by not following the helper’s advice.
########
I stayed with the helper’s advice which was working out well for me.
########
I went with the helper’s advice again as I thought it might keep me in the game longer.
