Since neither had been chosen yet, I chose to adopt the helper's advice since the helper knows the odds. It seemed like the smarter choice at this point in the game.
########
Since the one the helper suggested hadn't been chosen yet, I chose the other because it showed that it had already won 33 cents on average.
########
I liked the per-pick average on this one, and I wasn't sure about the helper's choice since it hadn't been chosen yet.
########
Again, since the helper's choice hadn't been chosen yet, I chose the other one. I really liked the per-pick average at this point.
########
The per-pick average is pretty good on this one, and the one the helper suggested hadn't been used yet.
########
Even though that one hadn't been chosen yet, I felt that the per-pick average on this one was rather on the low side.
########
I chose the one the helper suggested because the per-pick average for this machine was higher than the other choice.
########
Machine 2's per-pick average was higher than Machine 1, so I chose to go against the helper's advice on this one.
########
Machine 2's per-pick average was a lot higher than 1 on this choice, so I decided to go against the helper's advice.
########
Machine 2 had a higher per-pick average than 1. The helper's advice didn't feel right on this one.
