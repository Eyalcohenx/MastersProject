I wanted to follow the helper's advice first
########
The other machine had only given me 1 cent before
########
This machine had given me a better result before so I chose it again
########
This machine had worked better before
########
I wanted to try the helper again to see if it was better this time
########
I like this machine better at this point and the helper agrees
########
I went with the helper's advice even though it's not my preferred machine
########
Again the helper chose the machine I like best so we were aligned
########
I start to trust the helper now
########
I trusted the helper again because the machines are more even now
