Given an unknown state of the machines, I followed the helpers advice since they knew the average payout of the machines
########
Having only played the first machine, followed the helpers advice again to see the payout of the second machine
########
Helpers suggestion last round was good so kept with the machine on the higher payout
########
Helpers advice kept winning, so followed it again on the higher payout machine
########
On a roll, keep going with the helpers advice to choose the machine that's been paying out better so far
########
Still seemed like a good idea to follow the helpers suggestion and pick the machine that's been paying out higher rewards
########
Not sure why the helper changed machines, but gave it a try to see if this one was going to pay out well this round
########
The payout last round wasn't that great, so figured I would try the other machine again despite the helper's recommendation.
########
Not listening to the helper netted me a reward lower than the suggested machine's average, so I went back to following their advice.
########
Higher payout machine was recommended and the helpers advice had been good so far so I stuck with following their recommendation
