No data about which one was best yet so went with the helper 
########
Wanted to see if I would get more than the 43 of the other machine, basically trying them both out 
########
Machine 1 hit better than 2 
########
Same thing the average of 1 was so much higher than 2 kept going with it 
########
Figured I would try one from the helper 
########
Machine 2 was not hitting well compared to 1
########
I was pretty much just looking at the averages at this point and ignoring the helper, i had enough data to know which machine was performing better to that point 
########
Machine 1 started to miss so I tried 2
########
Same thing, but I wish I would have went machine 1 here
########
Decided to go with helper since was on a bad streak
