Had no experience with either machine, so why not take the helper's advice?
########
I was just curious and wanted to see what the other machine had to offer, and even if it failed, I would quite possibly have enough other chances to make it worth finding out (had padding in case of failure).
########
The two choices were neck and neck for the most part, so didn't really have a preference.
########
Wanted to see if it had a comparable result and it was recommended anyway, so might as well.
########
It looked like it might trend to being more profitable on average at this point.
########
Not any particular reason but to I might as well trust it as I had a feeling I was going to run out of chances to play soon.
########
Same reason as before, that I should rely on the advice of the helper as I felt like the game would most likely wrap up soon.
########
Same as before, just trusting the helper because I didn't think it would matter anyway.
########
May as well choose the helper.
########
My choices don't seem to be all that relevant at this point.
