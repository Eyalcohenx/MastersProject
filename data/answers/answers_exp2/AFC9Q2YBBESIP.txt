I figured I would play it safe and follow the helper's lead.
########
I wanted to see what the reward would be like if I did not follow the helper's advice. 
########
The rewards in round 1 and 2 were pretty much equivalent (19 and 17) so I decided to go back to following the helper's advice. 
########
Again, I wanted to see what it would be like to not follow the advice.
########
I was trying to balance out my selection of the two machines (i.e. alternate between not following and following helper's advice).
########
Following advice seemed to be yielding positive results so I continued to do so.
########
Wanted to mix things up a bit and see if the difference between not following and following advice was getting larger.
########
Not following advice felt like it was yielding larger rewards.
########
Got a bit nervous not following advice, so I reverted back to the safe course of action.
########
Safer course of action to follow advice.
