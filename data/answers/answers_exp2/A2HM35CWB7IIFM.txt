I wanted to see what kind of reward I'd get to gauge if the helper is truthful.
########
I wanted to try the machine the helper did not recommend, to compare the bonus.
########
This machine gave the higher reward. I also wanted to keep testing the helper's advice.
########
This machine has given good bonuses. The helper also chose it, which may or may not be good advice.
########
I want to re-try this machine, as well as the helper. The helper has picked machines with good pay-outs in the recent rounds.
########
The machine pay-outs are fairly equal and I do not fully trust the helper yet. I want to make sure I am not missing out.
########
This machine has a slightly higher pay-out average.
########
I am motivated mostly by the average payout for this machine, not the helper.
########
I am motivated, again, by the machine's past payout record.
########
This machine appears to give, on average, a better payout.
