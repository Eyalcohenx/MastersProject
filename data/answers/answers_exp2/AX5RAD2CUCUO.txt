It was the first round. So, I decided to follow the helper's advice.
########
The first round's award was good. So, I again went with helper's suggestion.
########
Trusting the helper's suggestion and the results in last 2 rounds. I went with it again.
########
The 3rd round's reward wasn't good. So, I decided to not follow helper's advice in this round.
########
Again, same reason. I didn't trust helper's advice.
########
Same reason again. I decided to go against the advice because I thought the reward in Machine #1 would be lower as compared to #2.
########
The rewards of Machine #2 were getting lower. So, I thought maybe I should go with helper's advice again.
########
The reward of the last round wasn't great. And I was going to go with Machine #2 anyway in this round.
########
Again. I didn't believe that Machine #1 would give me better rewards than Machine #2.
########
My choice and helper's choice was similar in this round again. I would have gone with Machine #2 anyway because it was giving better rewards than Machine #1.
